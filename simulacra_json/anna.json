Ruthless Bomb: The effect of Cross Snipe becomes a flame explosion that deals basic damage equal to 27.3% of ATK + 1 within an area. After charging, deal damage up to 188.6% of ATK + 10. Upon hitting targets that are not burning, inflict them with Cross Burn, which deals damage equal to 75% of ATK every second for 13 seconds. Upon hitting burning targets, inflict them with Cross Burn, and enter Burn Enhancement for 20 seconds, which increases burn damage on targets by 20%. When using Twilight Arc, you now throw 3 grenades instead. Deceitful Bomb: Changes the effects of Cross Snipe into a ranged Gas attack that deals basic damage equal to 42.6% of ATK + 2 upon hit. After charging, deal up to 294.1% of ATK + 15. Targets in the Gas will be slowed. The slow effect becomes stronger over time, and the Gas lasts 7 seconds. Twilight Arc can detonate the Gas (the longer the charge, the greater the Gas explosion damage), dealing explosion damage up to 316.2% of ATK + 17 (this is deemed as triggering Cross Snipe 1 time) and reducing the target's flame resistance by 10% for 10 seconds. Passive: After confirming the module, you will get a number of Optical Enhancement uses. Optical Enhancement: Reduces the charging time of Cross Snipe by 30%, becoming immune to control effects while charging. Recover 1 dodge attempt (up to 4 dodge attempts) every 2 dodges. Passive: While the Deceitful Bomb Module is in effect, Cross Snipe has a chance of reducing the cooldown of other flame weapon skills by 0.7 seconds after hitting a target. Passive Tranquil Heart: When Clover Cross uses discharge/skill/charged attack/dodge, increase final crit rate of Clover Cross by 3.5% for 15 seconds. This effect can stack up to 3 times. After crit rate exceeds 100%, 50% of the excess crit rate is converted to crit damage, up to a maximum of 5.25% crit damage."

Damage immunity lasts 1.5 seconds when the skill is active (unavailable in Apex League)."
