While in combat, after every 0.5 seconds, the next Swift Cut damage will be increased by an additional 1 time, up to a maximum of 30 times. When multiple Swift Cut damages exist, the highest initial value is used for calculation.Fiery Explosion: Swift Cut damage is counted as discharge skill damage. If there is 1 frost/volt/physical weapon of any kind equipped, Fiery Explosion damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Fiery Explosion damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.
