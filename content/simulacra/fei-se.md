</center>

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Ignite </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy
</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 20% and Flame Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

**Searing Flame:** When Zhongrui is equipped and any weapon discharge hits a target, cause an additional Flame element hit to the target. Searing Flame damage: 500%*Flame Attack + 8.4%*Max HP + 300%*Sum of Resistances + 1,000%*Crit Rate. For every 0.5s in combat, the damage of Searing Flame is increased by 1 times, up to 30 times. If there are multiple Searing Flames being applied on the field, Searing Flame will immediately apply the highest multiplier. Searing Flame is attributed as Discharge damage, but will not trigger additional effects. Searing Flame is not affected by elemental damage increase/decrease nor final damage increase/decrease multipliers other than Titan unique stat. Searing Flame damage will be multiplied by 2.5x if there is any Frost/Volt/Physical Weapon equipped.		

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>



1★ The base damage of Heartburn is now 120%. If there are multiple burn types being inflicted, Heartburn base damage will increase to whichever burn has the highest multiplier.

3★ The maximum number of Illusionary Clones that can be on the field is now 2. When Zhongrui's Skill hits a target, an Illusionary Clone will be generated.

5★ For each Illusionary Clone and Lotus Petal in the Illusionary Field, increase the damage of Heartburn by 15%.
The endurance consumption of the held normal movement is decreased by 75%. This equates to 26s with 1,300 endurance.

6★ The base damage of Heart Eclipse DoT is now 900%/s, and its shatter is doubled. Heartburn now has a 15% chance of adding 2s of 65% slow (ineffective against BOSS enemies and unavailable in the Apex League).
