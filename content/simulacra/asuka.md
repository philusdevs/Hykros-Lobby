<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Armor Dissolve </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack inflicts armor dissolve effect on the target for 45 seconds, increasing their flame and physical damage taken by (and an additional 15% in team play). This effect will replace the grievous status on the target, and targets with this effect cannot become grievous. Physical attacks will stun targets under the dissolve effect for 2 seconds, and flame attacks will decrease the targets' speed by 50% for 5 seconds. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Fusion of Mass and Flame:** When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the currently equipped weapon's highest physical/flame base ATK, the highest equipped physical/flame ATK percentage, and the highest equipped physical/flame damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a physical and flame weapon. <br /> **Physical Resonance:** Increase Physical ATK by 20% and Physical Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Physical Resonance or Physical Reaction effects, with Physical Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 20% and Physical Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Flame Resonance or Flame Reaction effects, with Flame Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Divine Spear: Swift Cut:** When Spear of Longinus is equipped, upon landing a hit with any weapon's discharge skill, deal initial damage to nearby targets equal to 600% of physical ATK plus 10% of the Wanderer's Max HP to nearby targets. While in the combat state, after every 0.5 seconds, the next Swift Cut damage will be increased by an additional 1 time, up to a maximum of 30 times. When multiple Swift Cut damages exist, the highest initial value is used for calculation. Swift Cut damage is counted as discharge skill damage. If there is 1 frost/volt weapon of any kind equipped, Divine Spear damage is increased 2.5 times. In addition, Divine Spear damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ Increase the amount of Revenge stacks from 10 to 15, and when all Revenge stacks have been depleted, unleash a powerful attack from the Spear of Longinus, according to the current weapon element type. If the element type is Physical, deal physical damage equal to 5,000%, and if the element type is Flame, deal flame damage equal to 5,000%. If the current weapon element type is not physical or flame, no damage is dealt.

3★ When there is an AT Force Field on the field, attacks can ignore a certain percentage of the target's shield damage reduction according to the durability * 30% + 20%; when Fortitude Resonance is activated, increase shatter by 100% of the current AT Force Field durability * 100%.

5★ Each time a Revenge stack is depleted, recover 6% of durability for the AT Force Field.

6★ Increase the physical damage gained from AT Force Field to 50%, and flame damage by 40%. When Fortitude Resonance is activated, nearby teammates will now ignore the damage reduction caused by a target's shield by 15%, and will now decrease all elemental resistances of nearby targets by 12%. Only one of these effects will take effect at a time.

| **Strike Through the Clouds** |Throw the Spear of Longinus at the target to draw in nearby targets, dealing damage equal to 3,564% of ATK plus 188 to the target and temporarily immobilizes the target for 20 seconds. This skill cannot be refreshed. <br /> After successfully releasing this skill, gain 10 stacks of Revenge, and every time you deal damage to a target, unleash the Spear of Longinus at the target to deal area damage according to the current weapon element type.

The AT Force Field will not disappear when hit, and will only disappear once the force field duration has expired. Increase physical damage by 20% and flame damage by 15% while in the AT Force Field.
