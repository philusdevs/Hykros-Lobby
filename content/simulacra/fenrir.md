<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Volt </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will strongly paralyze targets for 1 second and electrify them for 6 seconds, removing all their buffs and dealing damage equal to 144% of ATK. Targets can't receive any buffs for the next 6 seconds.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Volt Resonance:** Increase Volt ATK by 15% and Volt Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Volt weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

**Elemental Balancing:** Increase all ATK by 15%. Activate by equipping 3 weapons of different types. This set effect also works with weapons in the off-hand slot.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ When Su-Paw-Star summons a consciousness and is on cooldown, gain the Aural Fever skill. Rush to the target and attack multiple times, dealing damage up to 720% of ATK. Each hit landed slows the enemy for a brief period and resto res HP equal to 100% of ATK. The last hit places 2 musical notes on the target. Aural Fever cooldown: 15 seconds. When 3 or more notes are deto nated and the cooldown of Aural Fever is greater than 5 seconds, clear the cooldown of Aural Fever. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds.

3★ While Songworld is active: For every 45% of max HP lost or when using the skill Aural Fever, trigger a Songworld Quake which deals damage equal to 650% of ATK to targets in the Songworld. For every 99% of max HP lost, gain 1 escape death (block a lethal effect and become immune to damage for a short time) for 45 seconds, stacking up to 1 time.

5★ Increase the damage multiplier of musical notes' deto nation to 40%, and the DoT caused by into xication to 1.5% of max HP every second. While Songworld is active, Songworld Quake is triggered auto matically if it doesn't trigger for 12 seconds while in combat.

6★ Increase crit rate by 18% while wielding Gleipnir. The crit rate increase lasts another 5 seconds after switching to other weapons.
