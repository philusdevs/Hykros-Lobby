<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Force Impact </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack applies Force Impact on the enemy for 45 seconds, increasing their frost and volt damage taken by 10% (and an additional 15% in team play). Force Impact replaces the target's grievous status, and targets with Force Impact cannot become grievous. Frost attacks will freeze targets with Force Impact for 2 seconds, and volt attacks will remove the targets' buffs. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Volt-Frost Fusion:** When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the highest equipped volt/frost base ATK, the highest equipped volt/frost ATK percentage, and the highest equipped volt/frost damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a volt and frost weapon. <br/> **Volt Resonance:** Increase volt ATK by 15% and volt resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more volt weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Volt Resonance or Volt Reaction effects, with Volt Resonance taking precedence. <br/> **Frost Resonance:** Increase frost ATK by 15% and frost resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Frost Resonance or Frost Reaction effects, with Frost Resonance taking precedence. <br/> **Thunderbolt: Swift Cut:** When equipped with Pactcrest ☆ Metz, weapon discharge skills deal damage equal to 46.87% of volt ATK plus 0.62% of Max HP plus 23.43% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 85.93% of crit to nearby targets. While in combat, after every 0.5 seconds, the next Swift Cut damage will be increased by an additional 1 time, up to a maximum of 30 times. When multiple Swift Cut damages exist, the highest initial value is used for calculation. Swift Cut damage counts as discharge damage. If any flame or physical weapon is equipped, volt damage is multiplied by 2.5. In addition, volt damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects. <br/> **Miraculous Turnaround:** When challenging Bygone Phantasm and Sequential Phantasm with Pactcrest ☆ Metz equipped, gain an additional 15 seconds to the challenge duration. When challenging Origin of War, for every 1 Pactcrest ☆ Metz equipped by the team, the team gains an additional 25 seconds to the challenge duration, up to 50 seconds.
