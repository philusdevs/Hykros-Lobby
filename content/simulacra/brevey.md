<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Volt-Frost Melt </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack increases the frost and volt damage received by enemies by 10% for 45 seconds (25% in team play]. Volt-frost melt replaces the grievous effect on the target and does not allow grievous to get applied again. Once every 15 seconds, a target with volt-frost melt will be frozen for 2 seconds when taking frost damage and will lose positive effects when taking volt damage.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Volt-Frost Fusion:** This weapon counts as a volt and frost weapon at the same time. When calculating damage, this weapon takes the highest volt/frost base attack in the equipment, the highest percentage increase in volt/frost attack in the equipment, and the highest volt/frost damage increase.

**Volt Resonance:** Increase volt ATK by 20% and volt resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more volt weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

**Frost Resonance:** Increase frost ATK by 20% and frost resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

**Miracle Twist:**  When equipped with Metz Pact Badge, you get an additional 15 seconds of challenge time in Bygone Phantasm and Sequential Phantasm. For every Metz Pact Badge equipped in the team, you get an additional 25 seconds of challenge time in Origin of War, up to 50 seconds.

**Thunderboom: Swift Cut:** When Metz Pact Badge is equipped, upon landing a hit with any weapon's discharge skill, deal initial damage to nearby targets equal to 600% of volt ATK plus 10% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 360% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 1200% of crit. While in combat, after every 0.5 seconds, the next Swift Cut damage will be increased by an additional 1 time, up to a maximum of 30 times. Swift Cut damage is counted as discharge skill damage. If there is 1 physical or flame weapon of any kind equipped, Thunderboom damage is multiplied by 2.5 times. In addition, Thunderboom damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.
