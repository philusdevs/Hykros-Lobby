<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Ice Shell </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will strongly freeze targets for 2 seconds and leave them frostbitten for 6 seconds. Breaking the ice shell causes additional damage equal to 144% of ATK. While frostbitten, the target's weapon charge rate is reduced by 50%.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Frost Resonance:** Increase Frost ATK by 15% and Frost Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>



1★ Gain 1 frostiness point every time you receive 550% × Frost ATK of damage in the Frost Domain. Up to 10 frostiness points can be accumulated. When the Frost Domain ends, frostiness points × frost ATK × 95% of blast damage will be dealt to all enemies in the Frost Domain. After leaving the Frost Domain, lose 1 frostiness point every 3 seconds.

3★ Increase frostiness limit to 15. When using discharge skills of frost weapons in the Frost Domain, deal damage equal to 25% of frost ATK × (current frostiness + 5) to all the targets in the Frost Domain.


5★ When shattering a shield with a frost weapon in the Frost Domain, freeze the target for 2 seconds and deal additional damage equal to frostiness × 35% of frost ATK. If the target cannot be frozen, the additional damage dealt is doubled.

6★ When frostiness reaches15 points and you are in the Frost Domain, you will get an additional "Domain of Frost II" that increases frost ATK by 25% when frost weapons are used.
