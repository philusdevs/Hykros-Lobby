<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Flame </h4>
When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy.


<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>


1★ Gain a stack of Strong Shield upon casting Discharge: Seething Rage. Using a dodge skill or branch skill while in shield form grants a stack of Strong Shield, which grants 10% damage reduction for 15 seconds and stacks up to 3 times. Switching to axe form converts all Strong Shield stacks to Sharp Axe stacks, each of which increases damage by 15% for 15 seconds. Switching to a different weapon cancels this effect.


3★ While in shield form, branch/dodge attacks deal additional damage to targets equal to 4% of the user's current HP.



5★ After switching to a shield axe, immediately grant 30% damage reduction that diminishes by 10% every 3 seconds, down to a minimum of 10%. Switching weapons cancels this effect. Cooldown: 30 seconds.

6★ Enhance conversion skills. Shield Conversion Enhancement: Increases damage dealt by 60% and expands the radius of the flame zone by 30%. Axe Conversion Enhancement: Does not share cooldown with Shield Conversion. For the next 5 seconds after using this skill, turns all damage received into HP (up to a maximum of 15% of the user's Max HP).
