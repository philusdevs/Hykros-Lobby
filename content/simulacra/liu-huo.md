<h4 style="text-align: center;">Trait: Ignite</h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance</h4>

**Flame Resonance:** Increase flame ATK by 15% and flame resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

**Fiery Explosion: On-Field:** When landing any hit with Pine Comet, it deals damage to nearby targets equal to 105% of flame ATK plus 1.5% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 55% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 200% of crit. This effect can be triggered once every 1.5 seconds. The Fiery Explosion damage is counted as normal attack damage. If there is 1 volt/frost/physical weapon of any kind equipped, Fiery Explosion damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Fiery Explosion damage is not affected by any damage boost.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancement</h4>

1 ★ When a Sparrow Feather hits a target, it triggers a spreading effect, dealing an additional area damage equal to 50% of the total burn and incendiary damage. It also spreads the affected target's Sparroburn to nearby targets, refreshing the Sparroburn duration. The spread effect can be triggered 1 time every 5 seconds.

3 ★ When your health is below 50% of the Max HP, every 0.5 seconds, consume 1 Sparrow Feather and recover 1.5% of Max HP. In solo play, the HP recovery effect increases to 3% until your health is full or all Sparrow Feathers are consumed. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

5 ★ When receiving fatal damage, prevent lethal damage 1 time and gain damage immunity for a short duration, and instantly gain 60 Sparrow Feathers and 1,000 weapon charge. Can be triggered 1 time every 60 seconds. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

6 ★ Increase flame damage by an additional 14% when you are under Pinnacle state.
