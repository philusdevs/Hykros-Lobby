</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Ice Shell </h4>


When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will freeze targets for 2 seconds and leave them frostbitten for 6 seconds. Breaking the ice shell causes additional damage equal to 151% of ATK. While frostbitten, the target's weapon charge rate is reduced by 50%.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Frost Resonance:** Increase Frost ATK by 20% and Frost Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type. </br>
**Frost: Detachment:** After using [Sword Art: Frozen Reflection], you will deal damage to affected targets every second for 30 seconds, equal to 1250% of cold ATK + 20% of max HP of the Wanderer + 750% of the sum of all types of resistance + 2500% of critical damage. Damage from multiple Detachments does not stack, and Frost damage is considered skill damage. When equipped with 1 electric, fire, or physical weapon, Frost damage is multiplied by 2.5. Additionally, Frost damage is not affected by any damage boosts, except for rare Titan equipment parameters, and it does not trigger additional attack effects.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancement</h4>

1 ★ After launching an Ice Blade, the character's Frost damage increases by 10% for 30 seconds. During this time, nearby enemies receive damage equal to 400% of ATK every second.

3 ★ The maximum number of created Ice Blades increases to 4, and the base damage multiplier of Frosty Roar increases to 1,800% of ATK. If the Frosty Roar effect is active on only one target for 6 seconds, it applies an additional Arterial Sealing effect, reducing the target's movement speed by 30% (does not work in the Abyss, does not work on bosses). If a target under the influence of Arterial Sealing is damaged by an Ice Blade again, it triggers an explosion, removing the Frosty Roar and Arterial Sealing effects from the target and dealing damage equal to 6,000% of ATK + 2% of the target's lost HP (the explosion damage cannot be less than 7,000% of the character's Frost damage or more than 12,000% of the character's Frost damage).


5 ★ The damage dealt by Crystal Cracks and Frosty Air is increased by 50%. The number of Light Fall charges is increased to 5, and the recharge rate of Light Fall charges is increased to 1 charge every 5 seconds.

6 ★ The radius of damage from Frosty Roar inflicted by the impact of Icy Blades is increased. Frosty Roar additionally deals damage equal to 4,500% of ATK to nearby targets.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Matrix </h4>

>  **2-piece:** Increases all elemental damage by 9%/12%/15%/18%. When launching Ice Blades, deal an additional 1600% * attack damage to nearby targets. Becomes effective in the background after equipping, and only the highest star level among multiple sets becomes effective.

>  **4-piece:** After releasing any frost weapon skill, increases final damage by 28%/32%/36%/40% for 30 seconds; while equipped with Monitoring Guards, increases all attack by 15%. Becomes effective in the background after equipping, and only the highest star level among multiple sets becomes effective.
