<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Frost Shell </h4>


When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will strongly freeze targets for 2 seconds and leave them frostbitten for 6 seconds. Breaking the ice shell causes additional damage equal to 144% of ATK. While frostbitten, the target's weapon charge rate is reduced by 50%.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Frost Resonance:** Increase Frost ATK by 20% and Frost Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type. </br>
**Extreme Cold: Unload:** After using Sword Art: Shadowy Ice, every second, deal damage equal to 70% of frost ATK plus 10% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 36% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 135% of crit for 30 seconds. Multiple Unload damage will not stack and Extreme Cold damage will be counted as skill damage. If there is 1 volt/flame/physical weapon of any kind equipped, Extreme Cold damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Extreme Cold damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancement</h4>

1 ★ After launching an FrostBlade, the character's Frost damage increases by 10% for 30 seconds. During this time, nearby enemies receive damage equal to 400% of ATK every second.

3 ★ The maximum number of created FrostBlades increases to 4, and the base damage multiplier of Frosty Roar increases to 1,800% of ATK. If the Frosty Roar effect is active on only one target for 6 seconds, it applies an additional Arterial Sealing effect, reducing the target's movement speed by 30% (does not work in the Abyss, does not work on bosses). If a target under the influence of Arterial Sealing is damaged by an FrostBlade again, it triggers an explosion, removing the Frosty Roar and Arterial Sealing effects from the target and dealing damage equal to 6,000% of ATK + 2% of the target's lost HP (the explosion damage cannot be less than 7,000% of the character's Frost damage or more than 12,000% of the character's Frost damage).


5 ★ The damage dealt by Crystal Cracks and Frosty Air is increased by 50%. The number of Light Fall charges is increased to 5, and the recharge rate of Light Fall charges is increased to 1 charge every 3 seconds.

6 ★ The radius of damage from Frosty Roar inflicted by the impact of Icy Blades is increased. Frosty Roar additionally deals damage equal to 4,500% of ATK to nearby targets.
