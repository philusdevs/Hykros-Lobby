### Awaken: Governing Blade

> Increase final damage by 18%. When Alabaster Tiger is equipped, gain damage immunity for 4 seconds when using Sword Art: Icy Beckon (unavailable in Apex League). For every 1 frost weapon equipped, increase frost damage by 2.5%. When 3 frost weapons are equipped, gain an additional 350 weapon charge after the Wanderer uses any frost weapon skill. After using any frost weapon's skill or discharge other than Alabaster Tiger's, deal additional damage equal to 1,456% of ATK to nearby targets.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Frost Shell </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will strongly freeze targets for 2 seconds and leave them frostbitten for 6 seconds. Breaking the ice shell causes additional damage equal to 144% of ATK. While frostbitten, the target's weapon charge rate is reduced by 50%.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Frost Resonance:** Increase Frost ATK by 15% and Frost Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type. <br />
**Extreme Cold: Unload:** After using Sword Art: Shadowy Ice, every second, deal damage equal to 70% of frost ATK plus 10% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 36% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 135% of crit for 30 seconds. Multiple Unload damage will not stack and Extreme Cold damage will be counted as skill damage. If there is 1 volt/flame/physical weapon of any kind equipped, Extreme Cold damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Extreme Cold damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancement</h4>

1 ★ After launching Frost Blades, the Wanderer's frost ATK is increased by 10% and nearby targets will be dealt damage equal to 80% of ATK every second for 30 seconds.

3 ★ The Wanderer can produce up to 4 Frost Blades and Temperature Reduction's damage's base multiplier is increased to 360%. If the target is the only one affected by Temperature Reduction within 6 seconds, additionally apply Vein Seal to the target, reducing their speed by 30% (unavailable in Apex League and against bosses). If the target receives Frost Blade damage again during Vein Seal's duration, trigger Icy Burst, dealing skill damage equal to 1,700% of ATK plus 2% of the target's HP lost at that point (Icy Burst damage will be no lower than 2,000% of the Wanderer's frost ATK and no higher than 2,200% of the Wanderer's frost ATK). Then, remove the Vein Seal and Temperature Reduction effects on the target.

5 ★ The damage dealt by Crystalline Crack and Cold Air is additionally increased by 50%. Light Steps' use attempts is increased to 10 and recovery rate is increased to 1 attempt every 3 seconds.

6 ★ The Temperature Reduction effect inflicted after firing Frost Blades is now applied to an area and also deals additional damage equal to 990% of ATK to nearby targets.
