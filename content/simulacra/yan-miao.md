</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Armor Melt </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will apply an armor melt effect to enemies for 45 seconds, increasing the physical and flame damage they take by 10%, and in team play this value is additionaly increased by 15% [armor melt replaces the grievous effect on the target and does not allow grievous to get applied again for the duration of armor melt]. Every 15 seconds, a target affected by armor melt will be stunned for 2 seconds when taking physical damage and slowed by 50% for 5 seconds when taking flame damage.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Physical-Flame Fusion:** This weapon counts as a physical and flame weapon at the same time. When calculating damage, this weapon takes the highest physical/flame base attack in the equipment, the highest percentage increase in physical/flame attack in the equipment, and the highest physical/flame damage increase.

**Physical Resonance:** Increase physical ATK by 20% and physical resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

**Flame Resonance:** Increase flame ATK by 20% and flame resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

**Flying Blade: On-Field:** When landing any hit with Equilibrium, it deals damage to nearby targets equal to 2,250% of physical ATK plus 38% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 1,350% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 4,500% of crit. This effect can be triggered up to 1 time every 1.5 seconds. The Flying Blade damage is counted as normal attack damage.

</br>
If there is 1 frost/volt weapon of any kind equipped, Flying Blade damage is multiplied by 2.5 times. In addition, Flying Blade damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

</br>

1★ The number of Flaming Daggers received from Empyrean Rotation is increased to 4, and the maximum frequency of Flaming Dagger use is reduced to once every 1.8 seconds.

</br>

3★ Wanderer ignores 30% of the target's physical and flame resistances [the total value of ignoring resistance to a particular element cannot exceed 50%]

</br>

5★ When Flaming Dagger is triggered, wanderer gains a shield equal to 30% of Max HP for 20 seconds. The shields gained cannot exceed 30% of Max HP [shields that exceed this value will be converted into healing at the rate of 50% of the shield].

</br>

6★ Flaming Daggers damage is increased to 8,800% and the final damage buff after a Flaming Dagger is triggered is further increased by 16%.
