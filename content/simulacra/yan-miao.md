<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Armor Dissolve </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack inflicts armor dissolve effect on the target for 45 seconds, increasing their flame and physical damage taken by (and an additional 15% in team play). This effect will replace the grievous status on the target, and targets with this effect cannot become grievous. Physical attacks will stun targets under the dissolve effect for 2 seconds, and flame attacks will decrease the targets' speed by 50% for 5 seconds. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Fusion of Mass and Flame:** When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the currently equipped weapon's highest physical/flame base ATK, the highest equipped physical/flame ATK percentage, and the highest equipped physical/flame damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a physical and flame weapon. <br/> **Physical Resonance:** Increase Physical ATK by 15% and Physical Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Physical Resonance or Physical Reaction effects, with Physical Resonance taking precedence. <br/> **Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 15% and Physical Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Flame Resonance or Flame Reaction effects, with Flame Resonance taking precedence. <br/> **Flying Blades: On-Field:** When hitting any target with Equilibrium, deal damage equal to 164% of physical ATK plus 2.3% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 85% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 312% of crit to nearby targets. Can be triggered up to 1 time every 1.5 seconds. Flying Blades damage counts as normal attack damage. If any 1 frost or volt weapon is equipped, Flying Blades damage is multiplied by 1.3. In addition, Flying Blade damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ Increase number of Searing Blades obtained when using Enduring Rotation to 4. Decrease cooldown of Searing Blade to be triggered 1 time every 1.8 second(s).

3★ Ignore 15% of target's physical resistance and 15% of target's flame resistance. (Each element's total resistance ignored cannot exceed 50%).

5★ When consuming a Searing Blade, obtain a shield equal to 30% of Max HP for 20 seconds. Shield cannot exceed 30% of Max HP, and 50% of the exceeding amount will be converted to healing. 

6★ Increase damage of Searing Blade to 2,600%. After consuming a Searing Blade, increase final damage by an additional 8%.
