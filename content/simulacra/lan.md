<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Flame </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy.


<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance</h4>


**Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 15% and Flame Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

</br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ Vermilion Strength: When equipping Vermilion Bird, the ammo costs of other weapons are multiplied by Polyfeather Parasol, and their damage, charge, and shatter effects are also multiplied by Polyfeather Parasol. Glowing Fire: When burn tally is triggered or when taking damage from Fiery Crash, 30% of the damage is transferred to the 3 units near the target (including the target itself) with the highest HP percentage.


3★ When using any discharge attack or shatter, all the active parasols trigger a Fiery Crash, dealing 30% of their usual damage 1 time. Reduce the ATK of enemies near the parasols by 15%. When in combat, spawn 3 parasols near the target immediately after dealing damage for the first time.


5★ Fiery Crash and the transferred damage ignore 60% of the target's flame resistance. Flame damage dealt by Corrosion is increased by 10%.

6★ Increase the damage dealt by Dancing Flames and Soaring Strike by 50%. The multiplier for spinning parasols, Phoenix Sweep, and Fiery Crash is now Polyfeather Parasol plus 2.
