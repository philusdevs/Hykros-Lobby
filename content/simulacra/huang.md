<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Volt </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will strongly paralyze targets for 1 second and electrify them for 6 seconds, removing all their buffs and dealing damage equal to 151.00% of ATK. Electrified targets can't receive any buffs for the next 6 seconds.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Volt Resonance:** Increase volt ATK by 15% and volt resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more volt weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

**Thunderboom: On-Field:** When landing any hit with Azure Dragon, it deals damage to nearby targets equal to 131.3% of volt ATK plus 1.9% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 68.8% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 250% of crit. This effect can be triggered up to 1 time every 1.5 seconds. The Thunderboom damage is counted as normal attack damage. If there is 1 flame/ frost/physical weapon of any kind equipped, Thunderboom damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Thunderboom damage is not affected by any damage boost except from the effects from Titan equipment, and cannot trigger additional attack effects.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ Each time after Thunder Burst charges, 2 Azuras will appear. Each Azura will restore 20% Max HP to other summons.
Increase Thunder Burst's charged attack and shockwave damage by 30%. After using Azure Moon, immediately gain 3 stacks of Qinglong's Might. Using other volt weapons' skills will grant 1 stack of Qinglong's Might instead.

3★ When Azure Dragon is equipped, reduce all volt weapon base skill cooldowns by 20%. This is not affected by other cooldown clearing, resetting, or changing effects. Additionally, increase the Wanderer's volt damage by 15%. This effect works in the off-hand slot.

5★ When the Wanderer receives lethal damage, prevent lethal damage 1 time and gain damage immunity for a short duration. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 60 seconds and works in the off-hand slot. </br> After activating Fortitude Resonance: Using Soaring Dragon draws in nearby targets, ignoring hyperbody (ineffective against bosses). In team play, Thunder Burst will produce 1 volt timestamp every 6 seconds while charging, which will link up in the order they are produced to form a power grid. The power grid can block enemies' movements and their projectile damage. Each volt timestamp lasts for up to 20 seconds.

6★ After using Azure Moon, increase the Wanderer's volt damage by 10% and final damage by 10% for 30 seconds.

| **Soaring Dragon** ![](https://i.postimg.cc/8kHFnMvC/Weapon-Azure-Dragon-Soaring-Dragon.png) | When weapon charge is full or Phantasia is triggered, upon switching to this weapon, remove all debuffs from the Wanderer and gather chi. Then smash the ground, causing an explosion, dealing damage equal to 1,514.7% of ATK plus 8,608 to nearby targets and suspending them. During the period, gain damage immunity for 1.5 seconds (unavailable in Apex League). </br> Passive: When Phantasia is triggered, if Azure Dragon is currently equipped or if switching to Azure Dragon from another weapon, deal damage equal to 5,000% of ATK to nearby targets. This damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats. This can only be triggered up to 1 time per Phantasia trigger. |
