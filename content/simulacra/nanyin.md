<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Altered Damage </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will mark the target, causing an explosion after 5 seconds. Additionally inflict 25% of all damage received by the target during the duration of the mark, up to a total of 560% of your ATK. Only 1 mark can exist on a target at a time.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**The Final Tune:** Increase ATK by 30%. Activate by equipping 3 altered weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.
**Imbue:** After switching to Purple Bamboo from another weapon, Purple Bamboo's damage element becomes that of the previous weapon.
**Inhabit:** The power of the Darkness is able to Inhabit any unlocked weapon. When Purple Bamboo is not deployed, the power of the Darkness can Inhabit any other weapon, increasing its damage dealt by 1%. When Purple Bamboo is deployed, the power of the Darkness Inhabits Purple Bamboo, increasing the Wanderer's damage dealt by 15%.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ For every 1 star gained by the Darkness-inhabited weapon, increase Inhabit's damage boost by an additional 1%.<br /><br />
Dimensional Collapse deals increased damage equal to (0.1% of total actual damage dealt in High-Dimensional Space by the Wanderer (excluding Void Trace) plus of 2,400% ATK) (counts as base multiplier, affected by damage boost).

3★ Void Trace inherits an additional 50% of the Wanderer's ATK. When taking lethal damage while not under Possession, instead of being defeated, consume Void Trace and become immune to damage 1 time for a short period of time. This effect can only be triggered 1 time every 60 seconds, and has a lower priority when similar effects are present. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

5★ While in High-Dimensional Space, ignore 20% of the target's resistances.
Up to 3 Void Abyss Currents can now be created.

6★ Dimensional Collapse now deals damage equal to (0.4% of total actual damage dealt in High-Dimensional Space by the Wanderer (excluding Void Trace) plus 2,400% of ATK) (counts as base multiplier, affected by damage boost).
