The Snake Chain can have up to 4 members. The element type of the transferred damage corresponds to the original damage and cannot be transferred again. The total damage transferred within 30 seconds cannot exceed the Wanderer's max ATK value multiplied by 2,400 (this limitation does not apply in team play). Damage from Dark Cut is not transferred. |
|| </br>  After using Absolute Rift, the Wanderer can also trigger Mighty Wind: Snake Chain members deal devouring damage equal to `25%` of ATK to nearby targets (including themselves) and reset the devouring damage counter.|
