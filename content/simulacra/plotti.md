<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Armor Dissolve </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack inflicts armor dissolve effect on the target for 45 seconds, increasing their flame and physical damage taken by 10% (and an additional 15% in team play). This effect will replace the grievous status on the target, and targets with this effect cannot become grievous. Physical attacks will stun targets under the dissolve effect for 2 seconds, and flame attacks will decrease the targets' speed by 50% for 5 seconds. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Fusion of Flame and Mass:** When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the currently equipped weapon's highest flame/physical base ATK, the highest equipped flame/physical ATK percentage, and the highest equipped flame/physical damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a flame and physical weapon. <br /> **Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 15% and Flame Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Flame Resonance effects, with Flame Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Physical Resonance:** Increase Physical ATK by 15% and Physical Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Physical Resonance effects, with Physical Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Poppa: Detachment:** After using Mirror Image, deal damage equal to 87.5% of flame ATK plus 12.5% of Max HP plus 45% the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 168.8% of crit every second for 30 seconds. Multiple Detachment damages will not stack. Poppa damage counts as skill damage. If there is 1 volt or frost weapon equipped, then Poppa's damage is multiplied by 1.3 times. In addition, Poppa's damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ While Poppa is Here is active, Poppa will launch a Heavy Energy Round II for every 7 explosive shot fired, dealing damage equal to 590% of ATK to nearby targets and then splits into several high explosives, dealing damage equal to 660% of ATK to nearby targets.

3★ After Poppa appears 5 times, increase final damage by 12% and physical damage by 6% for 25 seconds. <br /> After Poppa appears 5 times, the next use of Mirror Image will refresh Phantasia Cooldown and immediately trigger Phantasia.

5★ Reduce Heavy Energy Round I's trigger interval to 6 seconds. When firing Heavy Energy Round I or Heavy Energy Round II, also fire a Healing Round that recovers 10% of the Wanderer's Max HP.

6★ Mirror (Target)'s damage reflection effect can now also affect the target. Mirror (Self)'s damage reflection ratio is increased to 30% and the maximum reflected damage is increased to 800% of the Wanderer's Max HP. <br /> Additionally, while Mirror (Self) is in effect, every time the Wanderer takes damage, additionally block damage equal to 10% of Max HP (excess damage will be taken normally, unavailable in Apex League). This effect can be triggered up to 1 time every 3 seconds. During cooldown, when Poppa appears and admires herself in the mirror, reduce the effect's cooldown by 1 second.
