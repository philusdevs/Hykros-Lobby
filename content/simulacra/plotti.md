<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Armor Dissolve </h4>

 When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack inflicts armor dissolve effect on the target for 45 seconds, increasing their flame and physical damage taken by 10% [and an additional 15% in team play]. This effect will replace the grievous status on the target, and targets with this effect cannot become grievous.
 Physical attacks will stun targets under the dissolve effect for 2 seconds, and flame attacks will decrease the targets' speed by 50% for 5 seconds. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Fusion of Physical and Flame:**  When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the highest equipped physical/flame base ATK, the highest equipped physical/flame ATK percentage, and the highest equipped physical/flame damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a physical and Flame weapon.

**Flame Resonance:** Increase flame ATK by 20% and flame resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.

**Physical Resonance:** Increase physical ATK by 20% and physical resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot.



**Papa: Unload:**   After using Reflection of You and Me, every second, deal damage equal to 1,000% of flame ATK plus 16% of the Wanderer's Max HP plus 600% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 2,000% of crit to targets hit for 30 seconds. Multiple Unload damage will not stack and Papa damage will be counted as skill damage.


</br>
If there is 1 volt/Frost weapon of any kind equipped, Papa damage is multiplied by 2.5 times. In addition, Papa damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.
</br>
