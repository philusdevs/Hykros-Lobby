<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Force Impact </h4>

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack applies Force Impact on the enemy for 45 seconds, increasing their frost and volt damage taken by 10% (and an additional 15% in team play). Force Impact replaces the target's grievous status, and targets with Force Impact cannot become grievous. Frost attacks will freeze targets with Force Impact for 2 seconds, and volt attacks will remove the targets' buffs. This effect can only trigger 1 time every 15 seconds on the same target.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4>

**Fusion of Volt and Frost:** When the weapon deals damage, damage is calculated using the highest equipped volt/frost base ATK, the highest equipped volt/frost ATK percentage, and the highest equipped volt/frost damage boost, and the weapon is considered both a volt and frost weapon. <br /> **Volt Resonance:** Increase volt ATK by 15% and volt resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more volt weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Volt Resonance or Volt Reaction effects, with Volt Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Frost Resonance:** Increase frost ATK by 15% and frost resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with other Frost Resonance or Frost Reaction effects, with Frost Resonance taking precedence. <br /> **Chilling Strike: On-Field:** When hitting any target with Wicked, deal damage to nearby targets equal to 205% of frost ATK plus 2.9% of Max HP plus 106% of the sum of all the Wanderer's resistance types plus 3.9% of crit to nearby targets. Can be triggered up to 1 time every 1.5 seconds. Chilling Strike damage counts as normal attack damage. If any 1 physical or flame weapon is equipped, Chilling Strike damage is multiplied by 1.3. In addition, Chilling Strike damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects.

<br />

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>

1★ When dealing damage to targets below 80% HP, increase final damage by 12%. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. <br /> Being attacked when in Concealment state will not break Concealment and the maximum number of attacks that can be blocked is increased to 3 times. After breaking concealment by launching an attack, gain a shield equal to Concealment duration multiplied by 5% of the Wanderer's Max HP (does not exceed 120% of the Wanderer's Max HP). Lasts for 30 seconds.

3★ Increase Wicked's shatter by 20%. When Fevered Hunt is triggered, draw in and detonate all the ice cores around the Wanderer and enter Permeation for 5 seconds, during which Arctic Bite replaces the weapon-switching button (but this Artic Bite does not trigger the additional skill effects) and using it reduces Arctic Bite's cooldown by 20 seconds. Use normal attack to immediately exit Permeation.

5★ Increase Ice Core Detonation damage by 150%. After Fixate tosses the weapon and hits a target, places Snow Trace on the target for 5 seconds (triggered by the charged attack damage from Fixate). When Snow Trace fades, target takes damage equal to 30% of the damage taken during Snow Trace (does not exceed Wanderer's ATK multiplied by 650 in solo mode, and Wanderer's ATK multiplied by 6,500 while on a team). <br /> Damage is not affected by any damage boost effects except from titan equipment's rare stats, and won't trigger additional attack effects. Snow Trace can be triggered up to once every 30 seconds.

6★ The frost-volt damage increase from Arctic Bite can be stacked up to 3 times.

|   Attacks        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pillage** | While on the ground, use normal attack to launch 6 consecutive attacks (up to 45 ice cores may exist in battle at any given time). <br /> First Attack: Deal damage equal to 36% of ATK plus 2, and create 1 ice core. <br /> Second Attack: Deal damage equal to 46% of ATK plus 2, and creates 2 ice cores. <br /> Third Attack: Deal damage equal to 280% of ATK plus 15 to the target. <br /> Fourth Attack: Deal damage equal to 244% of ATK plus 13, and create 1 ice core. <br /> Fifth Attack: Deal damage equal to 380% of ATK plus 20, and create 3 ice cores. <br /> Sixth Attack: Deal damage equal to 315% of ATK plus 17.|
| **Hunt** | While airborne, use normal attack to launch 6 consecutive attacks in mid-air, consuming endurance. <br /> First Attack: Deal damage equal to 75% of ATK plus 4 to the target. <br /> Second Attack: Deal damage equal to 145% of ATK plus 8 to the target. <br /> Third Attack: Deal damage equal to 175% of ATK plus 9 to the target. <br /> Fourth Attack: Deal damage equal to 153% of ATK plus 8 to the target. <br /> Fifth Attack: Deal damage equal to 238% of ATK plus 13 to the target. <br /> Sixth Attack: Deal damage equal to 440% of ATK plus 23 to the target.|
| **Frozen Spike** | While on the ground, tap and hold normal attack when using the second, fourth, and fifth normal attacks to trigger Frozen Spike, leaping backward to charge while in the air, up to 3 charges. <br /> Phase 1 charged hit: Deal damage equal to 182% of ATK plus 10. <br /> Phase 2 charged hit: Deal damage equal to 320% of ATK plus 17. <br /> Phase 3 charged hit: Deal damage equal to 455% of ATK plus 24.|
| **Death From Above** | While airborne, tap and hold normal attack to trigger Death From Above. <br /> Stab the ground with the lance upon landing, dealing damage equal to 120% of ATK plus 6.|
| **Fixate** | While on the ground, hold normal attack to trigger Fixate to charge. Damage increases for 6 seconds depending on the charge time, during which the Wanderer gains hyperbody, and the weapon is tossed in the target direction. After the weapon lands a hit, deal damage up to 4,480% of ATK plus 236 to nearby targets. Aim assist is activated after aiming for 2.5 seconds during Fixate's charging. The tossed weapon automatically hits the target in the head (losing auto-aim does not affect charging). <br /> After Fixate tosses the weapon, a new skill button for Shadow Execution becomes available.|
| **Boneshaver** | While on the ground, tap and hold normal attack when aiming at the sky to trigger Boneshaver, during which the Wanderer gains hyperbody. Tosses the lance in the target direction, dealing damage equal to 160% of ATK plus 8 to nearby targets and placing Force Impact on targets hit. <br /> Boneshaver does not trigger Shadow Execution after tossing the weapon.|

|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Concealment** | While on the ground, tap and hold dodge to trigger Concealment for 60 seconds and become concealed (in solo mode, create an ice sculpture that attracts enemy attention for up to 15 seconds) and increasing movement speed by 30%. While concealed, the Wanderer blocks damage equal to 50% of Max HP up to 1 time (this effect can only be triggered up to 1 time every 10 seconds). Concealment breaks when launching an attack and dealing damage with Wicked, being attacked, or swapping weapons. <br /> **Hunting:** When concealment breaks from launching an attack with Wicked and landing a hit, trigger Fevered Hunt. This resets Arctic Bite's cooldown and increases the Wanderer's final damage exponentially by 2.4% to 36% based on the Concealment duration. Receive maximum damage boost after 10 seconds of Concealment. Damage dealt using Fixate to trigger Hunting also benefits from the damage boost.|
| **Impending Chill** | Use normal attack during the short perfect dodge window (use a directional button before dodging) to trigger Impending Chill, dealing damage equal to 30% of ATK plus 2 and creating 2 ice cores (up to 45 ice cores may exist in battle at any given time).|
| **Death Aflutter** | Use normal attack right after dodging backward to trigger Death Aflutter, leaping forward and dealing equal to 70% of ATK plus 4 to nearby targets upon landing. This also creates 1 ice core (up to 45 ice cores may exist in battle at any given time).|
| **Unforeseen Doom** | Tap normal attack at the moment the Wanderer enters concealment from holding dodge to quickly trigger Fixate, dealing damage equal to 160% of ATK plus 8. After tossing the weapon, a new skill button for Shadow Execution becomes available.|

|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Arctic Bite** | Swing the lance to tear through space, giving the Wanderer hyperbody and a 80% damage reduction for 2 seconds, dealing damage equal to 420% of ATK plus 22 to nearby targets, and creating a tear to draw in nearby targets that lasts for 30 seconds. This also creates 6 ice cores (up to 45 ice cores may exist in battle at any given time). Cooldown: 60 seconds. <br /> After successfully using Arctic Bite, increase the Wanderer's frost and volt damage by 9%, and the Wanderer ignores 15% of the target's frost and volt resistance, lasting for 60 seconds (each element's total resistance ignored cannot exceed 50%).|
| **Frigid Blast** | When Fixate tosses the weapon through the tear, the cold air explodes, dealing damage equal to 330% of ATK plus 17 to enemies near the tear, strongly freezing them for 5 seconds (triggers up to once every 30 seconds, does not work on bosses). Additionally, it draws in and detonates all the ice cores in battle, and places Force Impact on the targets. <br /> **Ice Core Detonation:** Each ice core deals damage equal to 80% of ATK to nearby targets, and the shatter from each ice core is calculated independently.|
| **Shadow Execution** | Move to the weapon's location and strike swiftly (if the thrown weapon has previously hit a target, then move in front of that target), dealing damage equal to 99% of ATK plus 5 to nearby targets (does not trigger the skill's additional effect). When Shadow Execution hits a target, triggers Phantasia if it's not on cooldown.|

| **Deadly Euphoria** | When weapon charge is full or Phantasia is triggered, upon switching to this weapon, remove all debuffs from the Wanderer. Yanuo stabs the lance into the ground, dealing damage equal to 368% of ATK plus 19 to the targets in the area ahead and creating 6 ice cores (up to 45 ice cores may exist in battle at any given time). During this period, gain damage immunity for 1.5 seconds (unavailable in Apex League).|
