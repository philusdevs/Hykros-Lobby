<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Trait: Flame </h4>
When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Elemental Resonance </h4> 
**Flame Resonance:** Increase Flame ATK by 15% and Flame Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.


<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Advancements </h4>



1★ Each round of Barrage deals additional damage equal to 2% of the target's current HP (cannot exceed 200% of ATK).

3★ Heavy Bombardment branch skill, and Close Quarters dodge attack inflict Ion Scorch on targets that are already burned, dealing flame damage equal to 40% of their current ATK every second for 10 seconds.

5★ The damage from Ion Scorch increases to 60% of ATK. Successful attacks with any weapon's dodge skills will refresh the duration of Ion Scorch.

6★ Barrage has a 15-second burning effect. Successful attacks with any weapon's dodge skills reduce the cooldown of Barrage by 4 seconds. This cooldown of the effect: 1.5 seconds. The DoT burn from the dodge skill also triggers a cooldown reduction effect.
