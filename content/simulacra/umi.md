When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will inflict damage equal to 137% of ATK, and make the target grievous for 7 seconds, taking 20% extra damage. When in team play, grievous targets receive an additional 20% physical damage.

#### Physical Resonance 

Increase Physical ATK by 15% and Physical Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Physical weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.


#### Advancements

1★ When switching to Mobius, immediately gain 30 warmup points. Cooldown: 17 seconds. Upon entering Magic Trick, deal area damage equal to 840% of ATK to nearby targets and reduce their physical resistance by 10% for 20 seconds.



3★ When ending Magic Trick early, deal wide-area damage over 13 seconds. The cooldown of Mobius' next skill is reduced, and physical damage is increased by 25% for a period of time (this effect does not apply to Mobius). If Magic Trick has more than 13 seconds remaining, gain an additional 200 weapon charge. The more time remaining when Magic Trick ends, the higher the area damage, the greater the skill cooldown reduction, and the longer the physical damage boost lasts. The area damage dealt is capped at 200% of ATK (the maximum damage is dealt when the remaining time is more than 13 seconds). The maximum cooldown reduction is 13 seconds, and the physical damage boost can last up to 20 seconds.


5★ Gain the Psychic Puppet effect upon entering Magic Trick, increasing Mobius's physical damage boost to 15%. During Magic Trick, recover 2% of Max HP and 10 weapon charge every second.

6★ When using Magic Trick, Mobius has an additional whip that is automatically swung whenever Mobius uses normal attacks or dodge attacks, dealing damage equal to 100% of Mobius's ATK (this damage is not counted as normal attack damage).
