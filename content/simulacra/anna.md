#### Element Type: Flame
When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will set the target on fire for 8 seconds, causing damage equal to 58% of ATK every second. Ignited targets have 50% reduced healing efficacy.

#### Flame Resonance
Increase Flame ATK by 15% and Flame Resistance by 25%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Flame weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

#### Advancements

1★ Hitting a target 2 times with Cross Snipe creates an Optical Space for 12 seconds at the target location. After an enemy in the Optical Space triggers burn tally, burn tally will be triggered an additional 2 times. When an enemy leaves the Optical Space, their speed is reduced by 80% for 2.5 seconds. Cooldown: 12 seconds. Targets of Cross Snipe will be terrified (speed is slowed by 80%) for 1.5 seconds. Cooldown: 4 seconds.

3★ After Cross Snipe lands a critical hit, recover HP equal to 50% of the damage dealt (not exceeding 15% of own Max HP and not including damage from Gas Explosion), and 50 weapon charge. Each stack of Tranquil Heart increases final crit rate to 6%, up to 18%, and converts up to 9% of crit damage.

5★ Ruthless Bomb Enhancement: While in the Burn Enhancement state, burn damage dealt to targets is increased by 30%. Deceitful Bomb Enhancement: Gas explosion damage ignores 30% of the target's flame resistance.

6★ Increase damage dealt by Cross Snipe by an additional 12%.

| **Ember Mag** | Switch modules to change the effects of Cross Snipe and Twilight Arc. Cross Snipe can be used up to 8 times. Skill cooldown: 14 seconds. Ruthless Bomb: The effect of Cross Snipe becomes a flame explosion that deals basic damage equal to 27.3% of ATK + 1 within an area. After charging, deal damage up to 188.6% of ATK + 10. Upon hitting targets that are not burning, inflict them with Cross Burn, which deals damage equal to 75% of ATK every second for 13 seconds. Upon hitting burning targets, inflict them with Cross Burn, and enter Burn Enhancement for 20 seconds, which increases burn damage on targets by 20%. When using Twilight Arc, you now throw 3 grenades instead. Deceitful Bomb: Changes the effects of Cross Snipe into a ranged Gas attack that deals basic damage equal to 42.6% of ATK + 2 upon hit. After charging, deal up to 294.1% of ATK + 15. Targets in the Gas will be slowed. The slow effect becomes stronger over time, and the Gas lasts 7 seconds. Twilight Arc can detonate the Gas (the longer the charge, the greater the Gas explosion damage), dealing explosion damage up to 316.2% of ATK + 17 (this is deemed as triggering Cross Snipe 1 time) and reducing the target's flame resistance by 10% for 10 seconds. Passive: After confirming the module, you will get a number of Optical Enhancement uses. Optical Enhancement: Reduces the charging time of Cross Snipe by 30%, becoming immune to control effects while charging. Recover 1 dodge attempt (up to 4 dodge attempts) every 2 dodges. Passive: While the Deceitful Bomb Module is in effect, Cross Snipe has a chance of reducing the cooldown of other flame weapon skills by 0.7 seconds after hitting a target. Passive Tranquil Heart: When Clover Cross uses discharge/skill/charged attack/dodge, increase final crit rate of Clover Cross by 3.5% for 15 seconds. This effect can stack up to 3 times. After crit rate exceeds 100%, 50% of the excess crit rate is converted to crit damage, up to a maximum of 5.25% crit damage. |

Damage immunity lasts 1.5 seconds when the skill is active (unavailable in Apex League). |
