Attack: 19 | HP: 1165 | Crit: 13 | S: 12.50 | C: 10.00

### Element Type: **Frost**

When the weapon is fully charged, the next attack will freeze targets for 2 seconds and leave them frostbitten for 6 seconds. Breaking the ice shell causes additional damage equal to 151% of ATK. While frostbitten, the target's weapon charge rate is reduced by 50%.

### Frost Resonance

Increase Frost ATK by 20% and Frost Resistance by 40%. Activate by equipping 2 or more Frost weapons. This set effect works in the off-hand slot. Cannot stack with effects of the same type.

#### Crushed Ice - Quick Cut

When equipped with Pian Zhen, after any weapon discharge skill hits a target, deal additional damage equal to 400% of frost ATK + 6.7% of max HP + 240% of all elemental resistance + 800% of crit damage to nearby targets. While in combat, for every 0.5 seconds elapsed, the damage from Quick Cut will be increased by 1 times, up to 30 times. When equipped with 1 volt/physical/flame weapon, increase the frost damage from Quick Cut by 2.5 times. The frost damage inflicted by Quick Cut is not affected by buff or debuff effects except from the effects from Titan equipment, and cannot trigger additional attack effects.

#### Advancement

1★ In the Martial Artist Form, for every 3 or more points of Inner Strength consumed, Pian Zhen returns 1 point of Inner Strength, final damage is increased by 5%, and Pian Zhen's dodge attack and normal attack will be increased by 50% for 30 seconds; In the Sweeping Form, for every 3 or more points of Fighting Spirit consumed, Pian Zhen returns 1 point of Fighting Spirit, and final damage is increased by 5% for 15 seconds.

3★ In the Martial Artist Form, if no Inner Strength points are gained within 4 seconds, gain 2 points of Inner Strength the next time any Inner Strength points are gained.

In any form, for every 3 or more points of Inner Strength or Fighting Spirit that are consumed by Pian Zhen, restore HP equal to 10% of your max HP, where this effect increases to 20% in single-player mode. This effect can only be triggered once every 8 seconds while in the Martial Artist Form, but has no limitations in the Sweeping Form.

5★ After Pian Zhen consumes any points of Inner Strength or Fighting Spirit, when fatal damage would be received, prevent death once, and then restore HP equal to 20% of your max HP (unavailable in Apex League), where this effect increases to 40% in single-player mode. This effect can only be triggered once every 60 seconds.

6★ In the Martial Artist Form, Pian Zhen's dodge attack and normal attack is increased by 60%, and its final damage is increased by 10% for 30 seconds after any points of Inner Strength is consumed. In the Sweeping Form, Pian Zhen's final damage is increased by 15% for 30 seconds after any points of Fighting Spirit is consumed.

#### Matrices

> **2-piece** When at least 1 frost weapon is equipped, nearby targets will take 65% ATK damage every second while in combat. Using any frost weapon's skill or discharge skill increases final damage 6%/7%/8%/9% for 30 seconds. This effect works in the background, and if multiple sets are used, the highest star set will take effect.

> **4-piece** After Pian Zhen consumes stacks of Inner Strength or Battle Spirit, final damage is increased by 12% for 15 seconds. Dealing frost damage increases all elemental damage by 12%/15%/18%/21% for 30 seconds. This effect works in the background, and if multiple sets are used, the highest star set will take effect.
