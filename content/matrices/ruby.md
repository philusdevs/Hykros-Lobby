> **2-piece:** Increase flame ATK after casting weapon skill by 8% / 10% / 12% / 15% for 25 seconds. If multiple star rating effects are triggered, the one triggered last prevails. This effect does not stack.

> **4-piece:** Grant Mastery after casting weapon skill for 15 seconds, with a cooldown of 15 seconds (Mastery shares cooldowns across levels). Mastery is not stackable. Increase flame damage by 2% / 2.5% / 3% / 3.5% every time the target is hit with a normal attack until the end of Mastery. Stack up to 6 times, adding a maximum of 1 stack every 0.2 seconds. At 6 stacks, grant a shield that can block damage for 1 time.
