> **2-piece:** Every time volt damage is dealt, there is a 40% chance of triggering chain lightning, dealing damage equal to 50% / 65% / 90% / 120% of volt ATK to targets, up to 7 targets. Cooldown: 2 seconds. Every time chain lightning is triggered, increase volt damage by 6% for 6 seconds (chain lightning will not trigger attack effects). This effect cannot be stacked. This Matrix's effect is also active in the off-hand slot, but only the set with the highest star rating will take effect.

> **4-piece:** Every time a volt weapon's skill or discharge skill is used, increase volt damage by 12% / 14% / 16% / 18% for 15 seconds. This effect cannot be stacked. This Matrix's effect is also active in the off-hand slot, but only the set with the highest star rating will take effect.
