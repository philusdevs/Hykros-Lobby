> **2-piece:** Increase frost and volt damage by 13% / 15% / 17% / 19%, frost and volt ATK by 5%, and movement speed increases while concealed by 20%. This set effect works in the off-hand slot, and only the set with the highest star rating will take effect. 

> **4-piece:** Increase all elemental damage by 22% / 24% / 26% / 28% when at least 1 frost weapon is equipped. This set effect works in the off-hand slot, and only the set with the highest star rating will take effect. After using Arctic Bite, increase final damage by 8% for 60 seconds. When entering combat with Wicked in the main slot, trigger a fully buffed Fevered Hunt 1 time (this does not count towards Wicked's Fevered Hunt cooldown, but it can only be triggered 1 time every 15 seconds).
