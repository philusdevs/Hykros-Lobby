>  **2-piece:** When at least 1 frost weapon is equipped, nearby targets will take 65% ATK damage every second while in combat. Using any frost weapon's skill or discharge skill increases final damage 6%/7%/8%/9% for 30 seconds. This effect works in the background, and if multiple sets are used, the highest star set will take effect.

>  **4-piece:** After Unity consumes stacks of Inner Strength or Battle Spirit, final damage is increased by 12% for 15 seconds. Dealing frost damage increases all elemental damage by 12%/15%/18%/21% for 30 seconds. This effect works in the background, and if multiple sets are used, the highest star set will take effect.
