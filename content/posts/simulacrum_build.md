Within the Simulacrum system we have designed it so that you can equip three Simularcums at a time, this will rather be easier to refer to as weapons

## Weapon Resonance Types
In the simulacrum system, we have a feature called Weapon Resonance which will provides you specific buffs based on your weapon loadout.

Weapons are categorized into Balance, Attack, Fortidue, and Benediction roles:

**Balance:** This resonance activates when you have at least one weapon of each role equipped. It increases damage dealt by 5%, reduces damage taken by 5%, and enhances shatter and healing by 20%. In team play, it further increases damage dealt by 20% and reduces damage taken by an additional 20%​​

**Fortitude:** This resonance activates when you have two or more Defense weapons equipped. It reduces damage taken by 25%, enhances shatter by 60%, and increases aggro by 800%. In team play, it further reduces damage taken by 20%​​

**Attack:** This resonance activates when you have two or more DPS weapons equipped. It increases damage dealt by 10%. In team play, it further increases damage dealt by 40%​

When roaming the world solo, we recommended remain on DPS to deal as much damage as possible. When roaming with other Executors, consider choosing a role that benefits the group as a whole.

Within these roles you also benefit from elemental resonance when you are equipped with two of the same elemental weapon.

## Gear

Gear is a critical part of your build, affecting your Combat Strength (CS) rating found in the equipment section in your backpack. It can include items like armor which can be found as loot from higher levels of Ruins, as rewards for defeating bosses, or found in chests after you achieve level 30.

You can manage your inventory through the Backpack menu, which allows you to view your equipped items, carried items, and switch between different themed tabs such as materials, equipment, cooking, missions, currency, and gifts.
