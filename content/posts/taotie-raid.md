As it were in the Zhuyan raid, there is a Limited-Time, mechanics-based raid for the newest world boss in 3.2, Taotie. Here are the mechanics (at least the important ones), and the recommended teams.

### Mechanics:

* Shield: Break the shield to damage the boss, and to have more damage dealt to the boss
* Chains: 2 chains will spawn on players within the raid. Run as far away from Taotie as you can to break them. This will also damage the boss.
* Mushrooms: Mushrooms will spawn on the ground. Collecting them has the effect of clearing Greying Bite, and if they are left on field for too long, they will despawn and heal the boss.
* Blue/red mushroom icons: After a shield, mushroom icons will appear on top of the heads, either Red-coloured or Blue coloured. There will be a red area on the floor, where players with the Red-coloured icon will have to go in, and the Blue-coloured icons should not be in. If there is 4 players with the Red-coloured icon in the area at the end of the mechanic, then there will be a "success", or otherwise there will be a wipe.

### Recommended Builds:

Build 1 should consist of fully tanks and healers, and should mainly be used for first clears. The roles go as follows:

* 1x Main Tank, using Mimi/Lan/Saki/whoever with Shiro as their third slot
* 1x Main Healer, using Lyra/Coco/Fiona preferably
* 1x Icarus Healer, using 2 healer weapons and Icarus as the third slot.

  * Note: between the two healers, one should have 3* Fiona for the 12% execute
* 5x Shatterer Tanks, which should use the guide detailed \[here](https://hykroslobby.com/guides/shattering-guide/) to create a build.

Build 2 is mainly for attempting to get high rankings on the leaderboard, and is the same as listed above except having whale DPS (i.e. fully maxed, preferably also whaling on titan materials to maximise titan stats as well) instead of roughly 2-4 of the 5 shatterers, or however many can be swapped out for whales without losing the ability to shatter Taotie's shields.

* High shattering DPS teams are best, as being able to help with the shatter lessens the burden on the tanks.
* Attacking behind the boss rather than in front allows for the boss to not kill them, as it hits HARD.
