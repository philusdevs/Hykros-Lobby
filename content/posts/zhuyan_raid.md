This raid is different from previous raids in that it does not take much standard damage. The only way to damage Zhuyan is to shatter his shield or break his sword/spear.
It is ideal to bring shatter weapons and two main tanks. Benediction and Fiona are also very helpful.

## Background Information on Zhuyan

Zhuyan possesses a protective shield that diminishes incoming damage. If this shield is successfully destroyed, it becomes briefly stunned. Zhuyan's shield will dissolve and grant a new ability if its Maximum gauge is full.

## How to Counter Zhuyan's Mechanics

| **Mechanic**                      | **Counter Strategy**                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small orange circle around player(s) | Spread away/dodge, avoid overlapping.                                                                     |
| Big orange circle around player     | Stack and soak together, avoid cleave, main aggro tank preferably avoids stacking.                       |
| Deep red arrow in front of the boss | "Duel" challenge mechanic, main aggro tank stands in front, avoid aggro generation skills or being in front. |
| Sword/Spear                         | Dodge fire AoE, break the thrown sword or spear, deal damage to Zhuyan.                                 |
| Shield                             | Break the shield to deal massive damage, critical for avoiding a wipe.                                    |
| Icarus Benediction                 | Coordinate with Fiona, discharge Icarus or use Auxillary Fiona Torrential for maximum impact.             |
| Greying Bite                        | Communicate tank swaps to manage greying bite accumulation.                                              |
| Downtime                           | Avoid engaging Zhuyan when no sword/spear or shield, let main aggro tank kite until mechanics occur.       |
| Phantasias                         | Avoid blindly triggering Phantasias with dodges or Saki surge, prevent delays in Zhuyan's moveset.          |


## Ideal Party Formation

- 2 Main Tanks (Who can communication with each other)
- 2 Benediction (Icarus Benediction preferred)
- 4 players with shatter weapons (preferably in Fortitude stance)

## Relics

- **Main Tanks:** Omnium Shield (for aggro) and Cybernetic Arm (for movement)
- **Benediction:** Thalassic Heart, Alternate Destiny , Spacetime Rift
- **Others:** Anything but Omnium Shield. Do not bring a shield if not the main tank.

## Roles

| **Main Tanks**         | **Benediction**                  | **Others**                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|  Maintain aggro on Zhuyan | Heal the party               | Hover on sides of Zhuyan               |
|  Swap if too much Greying Bite | Shave off half 1st health bar |  Do not really engage Zhuyan           |
| Communicate with each other | Execute Zhuyan at low HP     | Shatter the shield, break the weapons |
|  Stand in front during "Duel" | Shatter the shield, break weapons | Don't die                           |
| Shatter shield, break weapons |  Don't die                   |                    |

## Additional Notes

- You can choose to do damage to Zhuyan, but make sure you don't take aggro off the main tanks.
- If you're in Attack Resonance, make sure you can contribute to shatter significantly; otherwise, you are more of a liability.
- Note that certain shatter ratings are a lie; i.e. Tianlang does not actually shatter much.
- Also note that if you do choose to go on Attack Resonance, you need to make sure you dodge avoidable damage because dying is a damage loss.

## Conclusion

This raid is all about mechanics. You need to know the mechanics and execute them well in order to win.
Shatter is very important. Make sure you bring shatter weapons and players who can contribute to shatter.
Communication is key. Make sure you communicate with your party members so that you can coordinate your attacks and avoid mechanics.
Don't die. Dying is a big damage loss, so make sure you dodge avoidable damage.
