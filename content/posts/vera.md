description: Consider the Simulacrum system. It's a meticulous blueprint of personalities and behaviors, stored in our database. Used with the AI within aslo side combat and medicine, and potentially unlocking immortality, it raises deep questions about our very existence and the nature of identity.

Before the Cataclysmic event, the plane of Vera fell under the rule of Hykros, but after the catastrophe, it lost touch with the main plane. It's surround  between two regions Innars and the Confounding Abyss â€“ and the emergence of Grayspace Entities poses a threat to its inhabitants, most of Vera's inhabitants sought refuge in  Mirroria 

Grayspace Entities emerged in the year 2701, three and a half decades post-Cataclysm. These enigmatic lifeforms, equipped with the abilities to fluctuate spacetime, wreaked havoc on Vera's ecosystem. They are abundant throughout Vera, and their home dimension, can be form in Vera called the Grayspace or the Pale Domain, They operate on a hive mind consciousness, each Entity draws sustenance from an enigmatic energy source known as Crystamax.

#### Common Grey Space Entities

There have been Artificial-Grayspace Entities created from native creatures surrounded Vera. Test Subject 6: Rudolph, an Animal-Grayspace Entity hybrid, who has the power to generate Crystamax, thereby transforming it into an Abyssant. Abyssants are powerful Grayspace Entities with their own Crystamax. Crystalmax grant each Abyssant a unique ability to create a field manipulating laws of physics in different ways. Surprisingly, the same Crystamax that was once a part of Rudolph later fused with Puppet Singer, another Artificial-Grayspace Entity. Despite their shared origin, each exhibited distinct abilities and elements.

#### Abyssant: Weaver

More recently, there has been a creation of a Human-Grayspace hybrids who was created by Dr. Rubilia.  Dr. Rubilia created "Ruby" through Crystamax chimerism and embryonic transformation. In her quest for deeper understanding, Rubilia too transformed into a Grayspace Entity, specifically an Abyssant named Harrah, after venturing into the Confounding Abyss. The motives of the Grayspace Entities currently remain unknown. 

## Mirroria
Mirroria, a part of Vera, was a Hykros base before it took on its current role as a refuge. The city stays floats, held aloft by anti-gravity engines, these anti-gravity engines rely on the sub-gravity field caused by the Confounding Abyss.

## The Confounding Abyss
The Confounding Abyss is situated right beneath Mirroria, its existence coming to light after communication with the construction team of the Third City went dark. It distorts surrounding physical laws and exudes a sub-gravity field.

## Innars
Innars, the "Second City," is an artificial metropolis nestled in Vera, extending from an underground cave to the seafloor, northwest of Mirroria. It was conceived by Mirroria to accommodate an expanding population and to avoid the lethal Omnium pollution on Vera's surface.

In 2667, a Mirroria exploration team stumbled upon an underground network of caves and rivers in the Karst Cave Z-059. This discovery led to the creation of Innars, with construction commencing in 2668. Once initial construction was complete, over 20,000 Mirroria residents migrated to the new city.
