# **INTRODUCTION:**

## **W﻿hat is benediction --**

## **W﻿hy play benediction --**

## ALL BENEDICTION WEAPONS AVAILABLE INGAME

\-Everything in the game can be jump/swap/dash cancelled
-all normal attacks (NA) have momentum that launches you into the direction if you interrupt it, thats why claudia is a thing
-targetting settings how it works 
	-manual > camera first > targetting on > use tab to lock on your aim
-NA/skill/discharge jump/dash/swap cancelling on ground
-only 1 jump mid air and 1 on ground
-na/skill during midair cancelling works often, only jumping has limitation
	-discharge can be only cancelled by jumping\
			-but once on midair you can only jump once 
	-dashes have 3 bars, regens over time
	-swapping has 3s cd as soon as you swap off your current weapon before going back to it

Spicy part
-grapple can cancel animation any skills/discharge
-hitting anything with grapple resets your jump. grapple gives you a lot of charge, weakens enemy damage dealt
	-but you cannot do NA for a moment
-grapple bugs out with omnium shield
-try not to cast it on ground
-ground and aerial gap close by using NA, theres skills that gap closes too and some of them plants your feet on ground to reset your jumps, claudia/em blade goes thru walls
	-eg: fiona, lan, icarus, zeke, lyra

dischrage to remove cc
recover by backdashing 
unfinished: groundtrouching

\=﻿========

Fiona (a0,a3 or a5 if have skill issue)

* Best all around support
  	- free charge and discharge from torrential always put on slot 2
  	- full heals on dash / discharge to fill the downtime
  	- tether buff is broken
  weaknesses:
  -cant clear graying bite for allies, only for self 
  -dodge spamming has big downtime

Lyra (a5)

* Guards = Death cheat for party at 5th skill/discharge (no cooldown) goes back to 0 after being used
  		- faster skill/discharge stacks guards faster
  		- fiona torrential being on x slot gives a stack
  		- icarus gives a stack per yoyo
  		- dont need to finish skill/discharge animation for stack
  		- a3 gives damage buff
  	

Zero (a0 or a6)
-Best survivability support + charge refund
	- 3 second iframes 3s cd 50% downtime 
	- get balls that orbit around you by dashing/discharging (max 5)
		-balls on close range gives charge when hitting
		-swapping or casting skill homes the balls onto the locked target for charge
		-always cast skill after discharge, you get a6 stacks depending on balls count when you press skill; you get 5 instantly after discharge so you want to follow up with a skill (a6 buff)

Coco (a3 or a6)

* Phys mains are gonna hate you, but they dont exist
  		- bee (a1) gives charge for party, damage% at a6
  		- damage buff (a3) when using discharge
  			- you can combine it with skill and it stacks additively
  			- make sure you stay on coco for the rest of the duration
  			- make sure to be able to discharge again on coco when swapping out on cooldown

Zeke (a1)

* Execute for mob floors
  		- Snake bite = Grievous

Shiro (a3 or a6)

* damage buff at a1 , 100% crit buff a6, shatter contribution at a3, Grievous(inconsistent)
  		-low uptime 8 seconds for 45s cd

\-Bai ling (a6)
-grievous

Nemesis (a1 or a6)

* Guaranteed full heal on discharge + skill 
  		- always cancel animation discharge, it heals anyway with a1
  		- volt support resonance, 25% atk only for self, but get value by using fiona tether
  		- good passive charge from turrets (immovable until pressing skill or finishing discharge)
  		- Electrocutes 
  		- Dodge = Heal over time
  		- Fiona dodge heal > nemesis but still decent

Simulacrum traits: 

Coco 

* must have on every party
  		-atk% for self(transfers some from fiona tether) and allies, healing bonus

Lyra

* if have survivability issues, casual gameplay
  	-hp, hyperbody
  Echo
* Optional if running 2 benediction

Zero
-niche for relic spam
