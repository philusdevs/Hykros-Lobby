description: History Log#1 The World of Aida.
---

The world of Aida unfolds a tale of discovery, power, and calamity. Its histroy can be traced back to mankind discovery of Omnium. Omnium with its unstable nature remained elusive to us until the advent of the comet Mara.

Mara, brimming with stable Omnium, set the stage for humanity's Interstellar Colonisation Plan. A liveable planet, Aida, caught the collective eye of the human race not just for its habitability but as the perfect launching point to mine Omnium from Mara. And so, humankind embarked on its cosmic journey, and Aida became their home.


To facilitate our grand scheme, we constructed the Tower of Fantasy, a colossal energy channeling structure designed to harness the power of Omnium and lock Mara into Aida's orbit. With access to stable Omnium, we saw the birth of groundbreaking technology that propelled our civilization centuries ahead.


Omnium became the foundation for our utopia, enabling achievements such as effortless space travel, superhuman augmentations, and manipulation of time, matter, and gravity. However, our organisation's obsession with time manipulation would spell disaster for our flourishing society.

Hykros our organisation, reputedly founded in the post-calamity, led the charge in Omnium-based research and experimentation. Our scientists discovered how to halt the aging process, granting near-immortality. This monumental finding fueled our ambitious, pushing us to the edge of what Omnium could do.

Our overzealous use of Omnium led to the Calamity, nearly eradicating the civilization of Aida. The cause? Undetected radiation emitted by Omnium, causing living beings to mutate into decaying-like monster we now call aberrants.

We discovered the link between Omnium radiation and the aberrations, we developed suppressors to councteract the radition but by then it was too late. Countless lives were lost, and Aida teetered on the brink of collapse. We were blamed for the disaster and a group of survivors called the Heirs of Aida united to challenge our authority.


Under the guidance of a mysterious sage, the Heirs of Aida began a war to resist us, fighting for control over a world we forever changed with Omnium.
