Hi everyone! Just thought I'd post a quick mini TLDR on Zeke advancements for those wondering about his value.

TLDR Version
============

- A0 Zeke is fine, A1 has ~10% value for Physical and up to ~20% for Flame (bc of Grievous), A6 is worth about ~10%

- A0 -> A6 Zeke is roughly +25% DMG in total, which is one of the lowest we've seen so far

- Zeke matrices are strong; stronger than GNN/Umi for off-field even if Zeke isn't in the team

============

Zeke's weapon is a hybrid of Physical and Flame, granting the resonances of each. You can activate both at the same time by equipping one Physical and one Flame weapon alongside it. However, for the purposes of matrices or other effects, Zeke counts as a Physical weapon.

Like other V3+ weapons, he has a weapon passive. Using his skill applies a DOT effect that scales with your attack, total resistance, max HP and crit, lasting for 30 seconds, and increased by 30% when using another non-altered elemental weapon. This is just free damage that will be up 100% of the time, but is unaffected by any modifiers other than skill damage on Titan stats. Typically, this passive will contribute **roughly 2% of your total damage**.

Zeke's trait buffs final damage, and also raises Physical Attack to the highest value out of elemental attack values (**this is a hidden effect that does not show up in stats**). On top of that, it adds a massive +50% multiplier onto normal attacks when using his weapons - this is additive with the base final damage on his trait. All of Gnunno's off-field damage is classified as normal attack damage, and is buffed by this trait, giving it huge value.

As for Zeke's combos, the only relevant combo in his kit is his basic attack chain for DPS, or dodging for additional healing (which comes from another part of his kit).

| Combo | MV%/second (incl. snakebite) WITH TRAIT | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto Chain | 458.74% | Best DPS combo |
| Auto hold auto | 185.55% | Don't use |
| Hold attack | 132.44% | Don't use |
| Falling attack | 201.86% | Don't use |
| Auto chain + dodge cancel | 454.77% | Good if you need to move or need more healing (as it procs two Snake bites) |

Zeke's skill groups enemies together, and buffs your physical and flame damage for 30 seconds, while summoning 4 totems. These totems shoot dark souls that do damage to enemies they pass through, and grant hyperbody when using Zeke's weapon.

Additionally, certain weapon combos will apply **snake bites** while the skill is active - the skill itself will apply one to the target with the highest HP, and then the final basic attack chain hit, as well as dodge attack hits, will apply a bite to the locked-on target. The Snake bite deals **150%** damage and heals you based on **12%** your max HP, and places a mark on your locked on target that makes them a Serpent Chain member.

You can have up to **4** Serpent Chain members marked. Dealing damage to any of them echoes **30%** of it to all of the members, including the base member, meaning that even on a boss fight, you are literally getting a **30%** echo on all your damage. Note that this echo effect only works for damage dealt by the current on-field weapon, meaning passive damage from your off-field weapons, such as Gnunno tentacles, will not get boosted unless they are on field. Additionally, Grievous effects applied to Serpent Chain members will be spread to other members in the chain.

Subsequent casts of Zeke's skill will trigger **Mighty Wind**, which deals damage proportional to the **25%** * amount of Devouring damage hits applied on each mob, which consists of Snake Bites and A1 procs.

When Zeke's skill is on cooldown, it is replaced by a skill that just pushes the dark orbs back to where they came from. This means you lose out on passive damage, but allows you to trigger **Selfless Realm** by doing a back dodge to hold attack, which has a lengthy cooldown of 200 seconds. Within the Selfless Realm, your next 3 basic or dodge attack hits inflict Dark Slash, which instantly executes any normal or elite mobs that have less than 20000x your ATK - to put that into perspective, if you have 30000 ATK after buffs, any non-boss with 600M or less health will get instantly one shot. That's a lot of damage! On bosses, or enemies above the threshold, 1500% damage is dealt instead.

Advancements
============

Zeke's A1 applies a small instance of Devouring damage with every Grievous application. When paired with A5 Gnunno, this is applied very frequently due to Treasure Tracer detonation refreshing Grievous. Additionally, this allows Flame weapon's full charge effect to proc Grievous as well. It has decent value in Physical teams, but is the most worth it for Flame to have consistent Grievous application.

His A3 allows the Mighty Wind part of his skill to turn targets into Serpent Chain members, which is nice for utility as you don't have to manually target enemies, but doesn't add anything outside base stats in the grand scheme of things.

Next, we have his A5, which gives **10%** damage reduction, doubled to **20%** in solo play. This obviously doesn't do anything for damage, but it helps a bit for survivability, I guess.

Finally, his A6 increases the conduction damage between Serpent Chain members from **30%** to **50%**. This is a decent damage increase for all teams.

Overall, most of Zeke's advancements are just utility - and unlike other characters, where you'll be missing key things like healing in your comp without certain advancements, the utility from Zeke's advancements is super fringe, so it's recommended to either get A0 or A6, with A1 being a decent stopping point for Flame or Physical teams - assuming you have A5 Gnunno for Physical.

Matrices
========

Zeke's 2-piece matrix buffs Physical and Flame ATK, and increases the serpent Chain member limit from 4 to 5, working in the offhand.

The 4-piece effect increases Physical and Flame ATK by a further 9% when applying a Snake Bite, and also increases final damage, working in the offhand.

Overall, this matrix is fairly powerful, being much stronger than Gnunno or Umi's matrices, even when you don't use it with Zeke. Lyra's 4-piece matrix still holds great value for Physical teams, due to the on-field camping in Physical teams - but if you don't have that, Samir/Shiro is competitive with Gnunno and Umi matrices for the on-field slot. Again, note that **these matrix values are solely for the on-field slot** - options such as Habo and Scylla will have their value halved in the offhand slot, so purely offfield matrices are still important.

Zeke's matrix is a considerable gain in damage, working for both Flame and Physical teams. Due to how little you gain from Zeke's advancements, it's recommended to pick up his 4-piece matrix over advancements, especially if you don't have any good off-field sets.

This concludes part 1 of the Zeke analysis. In part 2, I'll be going over teamcomps, in-depth rotations, and comparisons between other comps.
