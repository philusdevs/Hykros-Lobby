Ling Han is here! She's a powerful Frost main DPS who also is equally powerful off-field. Let's see just what she adds to the Frost meta by looking through her kit, advancements, matrices, and doing DPS calculations!

# Kit Explanation

**Trait**

Ling Han's trait increases Final Damage by **18%**, with **2.5%** extra Frost Damage per Frost weapon equipped. Additionally, when running Triple Frost, you'll gain **350** weapon charge when using any skill, on top of doing a large amount of bonus damage when any skill or discharge aside from that of Ling Han's. This is a very powerful trait and enables a quickswap playstyle, which we'll dive into later. *This trait is not procced by Alyss A1.*

Her weapon passive is similar to Zeke, dealing damage per second after casting her skill, contributing roughly 2-4% total damage, equal to:

**70%** Frost ATK

**10%** Max HP (may be a typo, if it is actually 1% then this is worth about half as much damage)

**36%** All Resistances

**135%** Crit

Ling Han is a competitive main DPS, and her on-field DPS at A0 can compare to that of A6 Yulan, not including the skill damage. Her autoattacks stack a DOT as well, ramping up over 8 seconds. Her strongest combo is her hold attack. Yes, she's literally Frost Mimi.

| Combo                   | DPS  | DOT (only applied on-field) |
| ----------------------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| Yulan A6 Combo          | 804% | 280%                        |
| Ling Han A0-A4 Hold ATK | 786% | 140%                        |
| Ling Han A5+ Hold ATK   | 786% | 210%                        |

Her skill deals a small amount of damage with a long cast time, but triggers a number of effects, shown below. You don't need to sit through the whole animation - as soon as your character begins to point the sword, the skill has been executed.

**Cold Air**: **88.4%**/s AOE DOT (30s)

**Frost Blade: 468%** Skill Damage to locked on target every **7.5s**, up to 3 blades in total. Inflicts **Temperature Reduction**

**Temperature Reduction:** **312%** AOE DOT every 3 seconds

Finally, her discharge deals quite a significant amount of damage, but has an equally significant cast time, making it cancel-worthy in certain comps. It comes with a Frost damage buff, however, but you can cancel the discharge after roughly 1 second and still get some of the damage as well as this 30 second buff.

![r/TowerofFantasy - Discharge cancel timing](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-jalznzcnztvb1.gif?width=1092&auto=webp&s=5e192b42e6a40a0caa3dba8a1e3e80a8db9588ba)

Discharge cancel timing

In terms of shatter and charge, she doesn't excel at either. Her charge is abysmally slow, and her shatter is equally mediocre, despite having an "SS" rating.

Like Fei Se, she also comes with some flying utility. If you don't mind looking silly, you can press your hotkey for eating food as you jump, making you fly extremely fast while T-posing. Forget Ling Han; now we Fling Han. What a way to assert dominance.

That covers her kit. Next are the advancements!

# Advancements

For advancements, we'll compare the relative value of each advancement in three different team comps: A Yulan Main DPS comp with Fiona, then a support Yulan comp with Fiona, and finally, a triple Frost comp with Icarus and support Yulan.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-c3lstostztvb1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=144aa8838a605a46e14bae75dd735ad52d38a60f)

Her A1 gives you a **10%** Frost ATK buff and applies a **104%** DOT effect for 30 seconds after launching a Frost Blade. It's worth a decent chunk in all teams, but the passive damage is relatively a larger % of damage in the MDPS comps.

Next is her A3, which increases the Temperature Reduction DOT from **312%** to **468%**, increases Frost Blades per skill to **4**, and causes every other Frost Blade to do **2000%** to **2200%** skill damage (based on target's missing HP), but removes the aforementioned DOT in between blades. As such, this advancement isn't worth as much damage as you would think.

Her A5 increases the damage from the Cold Air DOT and the on-field Crystalline Crack DOT by **50%**. Both of these effects are a fairly low value to begin with - to put this in perspective, Crystalline Crack increasing by 50% is around a 5% gain for her as a main DPS - so this advancement also has a low value, but obviously, is the most useful for the Ling Han main DPS comp. This advancement also lets you have up to 10 Light Steps up from 2, allowing you to get around much easier.

Finally, her A6 applies **1170%** AOE skill damage with every Frost Blade, as well as making the Temperature Reduction effect AOE. This adds a good amount of damage in all teams.

Compared to Yulan, the value of her advancements is much more tame. Advancements are worth the least relatively in the Triple Frost comp, which already has very high base damage. We'll dive more into it in the comparison section. Next, let's talk about matrices!

**Value of Advancements: Relative gain from A0 Ling Han**

| Advancement | Ling Han Main DPS | Yulan Main DPS | Triple Frost |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| A0          | 100%              | 100%           | 100%         |
| A1          | 114%              | 114%           | 112%         |
| A3          | 124%              | 123%           | 117%         |
| A5          | 132%              | 128%           | 121%         |
| A6          | 143%              | 139%           | 128%         |

# Matrices

Her 2-piece increases all elemental damage by **7/8/9/10%** , and deals an additional **416%** AOE damage per Frost Blade, working in the offhand.

Her 4-piece increases final damage by **12/15/19/23%** for **30** seconds after using any Frost discharge. It also gives a passive **12%** attack when using her weapon.

The below matrix tables use the **Ling Han Main DPS** comp as a base.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-twcsvosf0uvb1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=03d42e8936031b292b168d97b69b42bce5402be3)

How do her matrices compare to others? Let's look at a table for the on-field values of matrices, using the Ling Han main DPS comp as a base reference. Her matrix is roughly the same power as Yulan's. A 3* main DPS set like Samir/Shiro is still competitive with a 0* limited set when competing for the on-field slot, however.

When comparing to the off-field slots, her matrices offer a big improvement over F2P options, though come fairly close to Saki 3\* matrices if you happen to have those.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-weojt64h0uvb1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=078a91a95afce778cfd23fe22f9c9e28c6805bd3)

Assuming you don't have two limited matrix sets already, her matrices are recommended over advancements if going for a Triple Frost setup, but roughly on-par with the value of advancements in other teams.

Speaking of teams - let's dig into teamcomps next!

# Teamcomps

We'll focus on the same teamcomps we covered in the advancements section - a Yulan main DPS team with Fiona, a Ling Han main DPS team with Yulan support and Fiona, and a Triple Frost team with Icarus and Yulan.

# Ling Han Main DPS

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-hf7s36mn0uvb1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dac267fc1df32975d4c1f492ebb17c73765b900)

Let's start out with the Ling Han main DPS team. We'll use Sweeping Yulan and Fiona here as supports, though you can replace Fiona or Yulan with Frigg, Alyss, or Zeke for slightly lower results. We use Ling Han, Yulan, and Fiona matrices here. For Fiona's first skill, Torrential Force is necessary to get the charge required for the rotation. If you have 1.6M HP, use Wellspring and Ling Han's trait; otherwise, use Hydro Focus and Fiona's trait. This order matters; Torrential Force is a 30 second buff, so it won't fall off during the rotation, but Hydro Focus and Wellspring only last 20 seconds, so putting it in the 2nd slot allows you to refresh it while on Ling Han. Thalassic Heart A3 and Overdrive Shot are ideal, though Couant II or Omnium Shield A5 are suitable replacements for either slot. For Titan stats, normal attack is ideal, though skill damage comes close.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-u63pmfkp0uvb1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a70b0ff0c55daaee6e71c379579cb784014896)

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-8r1slg0t0uvb1.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed78d7225989943e5fa836ad1a667d7acc31b134)

Start out with Yulan's discharge and skill, followed by that of Fiona, and then that of Ling Han. For the first rotation only, you can cancel Ling Han's discharge after 1 second. Use her hold attack until roughly 12 seconds are left on her cooldown, then repeat the rotation with Yulan's discharge. In this 2nd rotation and subsequent rotations, you can let Ling Han's discharge go off, as all buffs should be ticking.

# Yulan Main DPS

![r/TowerofFantasy - Important to note alternatives do NOT includes matrices. If you use Frigg, you can't even use Icarus or Alyss matrix - you need to downgrade all the way to Saki.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-fa4bzrhu0uvb1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c594843fb761efcdb6a8ee44e28d69fe4c7d3b2)

Important to note alternatives do NOT includes matrices. If you use Frigg, you can't even use Icarus or Alyss matrix - you need to downgrade all the way to Saki.

With Yulan main DPS, we run Fiona as a support, though Alyss, Frigg, or even Zeke can work in this spot instead. We'll use the respective matrices here - Yulan, Ling Han, and Fiona. Wellspring and Maelstrom are the preferred Fiona skills, alongside Yulan's trait. For relics, we use Thalassic Heart and Overdrive Shot. Run skill damage on your titan stats for maximum damage.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-yekl4bzy0uvb1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=712a1fcf771305fb436ffccfc9a1fdf8a8f3382a)

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-gjm5lchx0uvb1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=e98afc10b7dbb5628dd820e48c021006e5a88168)

Start out with Ling Han's discharge, cancelling after 1 second and then casting her skill. Cancel her skill when it resolves for a quick autoattack to get a free DOT and Yulan stack, then use Fiona's skill and discharge. Switch to Yulan, pop Overdrive Shot, and do her dodge to auto combo and immediately use her skill with the 3 stacks you get. Continue her dodge to auto combo and use a 5 stack skill when available, and continue DPSing until Maelstrom has around 7s left, and then repeat the rotation with Ling Han's discharge.

Note that you still need to manage stacks on Yulan; ideally, you'll want to use them after Maelstrom is ramped up, but before Wellspring drops off. If you manage this properly, you should never overcap stacks.

# Triple Frost

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-t0w8vrz31uvb1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5020f1f374fe10a7593b9158c6ab51403293f9cb)

Finally, let's look at a triple Frost comp. Here, we use Sweeping Yulan and Icarus. For matrices, we'll use Ling Han, Yulan, and Icarus - however, Claudia matrices are also a viable choice here in place of Icarus - the damage may be a bit lower, but the rotation will be more smooth. We'll use Thalassic Heart and Omnium Shield here as relics, and Ling Han's trait. As you might imagine, skill damage is the optimal titan stat here.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-gc5fh4891uvb1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=687b70f7dd8961073cb36e67d6585b78b2dba04b)

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-w5cxbd051uvb1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=2213e6cc326a48c6a9848f57cea11a1266d83208)

Start out with Ling Han's skill, followed by Yulan's discharge and skill. Discharge to Icarus, instantly cancel it, and use his skill and two follow-up skills. From here on out, we'll be doing a 1232 alternation - discharge to Ling Han, then Icarus, then Yulan, then Icarus again, then repeat.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 1232 alternation between characters.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-yygkgn661uvb1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1388cc4d145b5ac64a5f2238554d0ae17e578b7)

1232 alternation between characters.

Use Ling Han's skill whenever it is up, but at some points of the rotation, you'll be stuck on Ling Han with only a half a charge bar - in this case, you'll need to use Ling Han's hold attack to buy time as you wait for her skill to come off cooldown to continue the rotation. In a Claudia matrix comp, you won't ever have to wait for the skill cooldown, but sometimes you'll need to auto a couple times for a bit of charge.

# Comparisons

Let's now dive into comparisons, starting with Ling Han's comps! Here's a chart to compare the damage potential between the different teamcomps with a variable advancement of Ling Han. Note that this is without matrices. With A0 Ling Han, Triple Frost is actually the strongest in terms of raw damage potential. Ling Han main DPS is surprisingly close to Yulan main DPS even at A0 as well. At A6, all the comps reach roughly the same potential, but Yulan main DPS is the strongest by a little bit. However, when matrices are in play, Yulan main DPS will be slightly weaker due to not utilizing Fiona's 4-piece to the same efficiency as the Ling Han comp.

![r/TowerofFantasy - NOTE THAT THIS IS WITHOUT MATRICES!](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-ww3n0udb1uvb1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59e2f6756ee51840163d76941d329d459fd07c1)

NOTE THAT THIS IS WITHOUT MATRICES!

What if you have both Yulan and Ling Han at A0... which one is more worth getting advancements in? Unsurprisingly, if you don't have either of them invested in, it's better to invest in Ling Han, as Yulan's advancements don't add too much in Sweeping form.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-qqmahfod1uvb1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa5d14688c1685b966474237fca94b147ab279e2)

Finally, what if you have Yulan and Fiona already invested in, how does Ling Han compare to other options? She's just... better, in all cases except if you have an A6 Alyss, in which case you'll need A1 Ling Han for a damage gain. It is what it is.

So how does she stack up to the rest of the meta? Here's a theoretical DPM chart with maximum investment and relics. The red bar represents the bonus from Fiona Execute, and the purple is the relative gain verses 45% resistance. The two Ling Han Fiona comps are a good deal stronger than the Triple Frost comps without even considering execute, and the Triple Frost comps are around similar strength to a Zeke Fei Se comp. Ling main DPS overtakes the Yulan main DPS comp ever so slightly, on top of being more straightforward to play.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-y0w1k4cf1uvb1.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=221517b4b548dbda7a8133402804f5da446f4e8b)

At a dolphin investment level with no limited matrices, the Ling Han comps are all much closer to each other. Claudia matrices perform better than Samir/Shiro, and make Triple Frost competitive with the Fiona comps at this level.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-t2t7k85i1uvb1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ca8d8d2474f4d3232dc76a5db83261c50b2b5a)

When we step down to A3 characters, the Triple Frost comps start to outshine the main DPS comps, which are a nudge below the Fei Se Zeke comp as well.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-2xu24m2j1uvb1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=313b0e49a75d0c2d8cb1fb737486d0d0a4808f56)

Finally, at an A1 investment level with 0\* matrices, Triple Frost overtakes Flame as the most F2P-friendly comp, though all the Ling Han builds are fairly strong overall.

![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Ling Han Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-ling-han-analysis-guide-v0-mm2hyzzj1uvb1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=094c3923aef7541cd3560cd9419d99a2266769c9)

# Summary

Ling Han is a very powerful character who maintains a similar main DPS potential across her advancements, as opposed to Yulan who was extremely advancement dependent as a main DPS. At maximum investment, both Yulan main DPS and Ling Han can perform similarly, but Ling Han opens the opportunity for lower investment Frost to shine.
