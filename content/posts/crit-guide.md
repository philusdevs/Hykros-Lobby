description: A guide for what crit is, and the ways to get it.

Crit is an important stat for players within Tower of Fantasy, and getting it should be a mid-game and end-game goal.

### What is crit?

Crit, short for critical, is a stat that is used in calculating how often you will do an extra amount of damage in a hit. The damage that has crit is denoted with a \* symbol next to the damage number, as shown below.

Although it is somewhat arbitrary as a stat on its own, it has a very important use, which is being calculated into crit rate. By clicking on the crit stat in the "Wanderer" page, you will be able to see the crit rate% for an enemy at your level. Note: your crit stat is not affected by the Wanderer's level, only by the enemy's. Therefore, the crit rate% is only a general indicator of how often you will crit.

A general indicator, for targets under level 80, for the crit rate, can be calculated as a decimal using the formula presented here:

Crit Rate = (crit/(target level\*2.666-27))/100

If this comes out to 1.0 or above, it means you are guaranteed to crit an enemy at that particular level.

Unfortunately, there is not an indicator for mobs above level 80 right now. Using the crit rate calculation on a mob above level 80 will lead to results higher than they should be.

### How to get crit:

Crit is mainly gotten through weapon stats (when they do not have resistance stat), matrices stats (Mind pieces), and the main way is through the Gloves and Boots pieces.

As with all of the equipment pieces, the advancements can add a range to each of the random stats that the piece has, and with the Gloves and Boots, you want for as many rolls as possible to go into the crit stat. When starting out, you should aim to get at least 3 rolls into the crit stat, and get roughly 3000 crit on a piece. The glove shown below would be good for a starter.

Whilst later on in the game, you would want to aim for 4-5 rolls into crit, with 4000 crit at least. The piece shown below is what I currently have on my main account, with it being augmented into a Titan piece.

Boots and gloves both have the same amount of crit they can get, but since gloves are able to be augmented but boots are not right now, the focus should be on getting high crit on gloves before moving on to boots.

Although there are other ways to get crit, such as through the crit% stat on the visor piece, it is not recommended to try and get a high stat on this piece, as it is more worth to try and get other stats on it (i.e. attack stats), but having the crit% stat on the piece without any rolls can be good for augmenting when it comes to the visor in the future.
