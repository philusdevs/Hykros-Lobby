![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-md3w51m9jmcb1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b27dce451c1d5421c024d20eb54ff43ff69d043)


Let's start with Yulan's weapon passive. When casting a discharge, this deals damage proportional to crit rate, attack, and total resistance, scaling up over 15 seconds, with each stack multiplying its damage linearly. Essentially, as long as you're casting a discharge every 15 seconds or fewer, you can think of this as free DPS. Similar to the damage from Liu Huo's weapon passive, this does not scale with any multipliers other than Titan stats, although it's not recommended focusing on this as the contribution is very small.

Yulan can pick between two different forms: Martial Artist, and Sweeping Force. You can select one of these in the options menu of the weapon screen. Martial Artist Form is focused on main DPSing on Yulan, while Sweeping Force is a support option. The base kit is mostly the same, with additional effects based on the form.

Let's start off by talking about the Martial Artist Form. This branch enhances Yulan's dodge and basic attacks by 40%, and also gives hyperbody to her dodges. It also gives access to a new combo chain where dodging lets you instantly start with the 4th autoattack in the chain. This skips the low damage half of the combo, and then additionally applies a potent DOT. Using the dodge attack into the 4th and 5th autos, dodging and repeating before getting to the last hit, is the optimal combo to spam for DPS.


In Martial Artist Form, you'll also build up stacks of Internal Strength with every 3 hits of normal or dodge attacks, limited to one stack per 2 seconds. This effect stacks up to 10, and up to 5 stacks are consumed upon using her skill, granting up to a **3x damage multiplier**. When copied by Alyss, it will maintain the same bonus damage multiplier.

Her skill also grants a bonus Frost damage buff after use, while restoring dodges so you can keep using her dodge autoattack combo. When reaching 5 stacks, the skill's cooldown is reset. Because the skill's damage is tied to the stacks of Internal Strength, this heavily dilutes the value of using Saki for resets, and can even be a DPS loss compared to autoattacking at higher Yulan advancements.

When using Sweeping Force form, using Yulan's discharge will grant a Frost damage buff and enter the Anticipate state, which grants you one stack of Fighting Spirit every 0.8 seconds, and additionally refunds 1000 weapon charge once per 10 seconds.

After using any skill, up to 5 Anticipate stacks are consumed, dealing bonus damage and a non-stackable DOT effect, while also granting a couple seconds of Hyperbody.

Finally, Yulan's trait boosts final damage by **18%**, with extra **7%** final damage for her Martial Artist Form and additional damage from her on-skillcast damage in Sweeping Force form by **9%** per frost weapon, with an extra **8%**Frost Damage if you run triple frost. This is ideal for triple Frost and Martial teams.

This covers the basics of her kit. Next, it's onto advancements!

Advancements
============

Yulan's advancements can have varying values depending on the team, so we'll look at a number of comps: a Martial Yulan comp with Alyss and Fiona, then a Sweeping Yulan comp with Icarus and Fiona, and finally, a double Altered, and triple Frost comp, both with support Yulan.

Remember that the numbers that will be shown are for seeing the value of pulling advancements, and is not meant to compare the comps to each other, as each comp will start at a baseline of 100% value regardless of their damage output.

Her A1 refunds one Internal Strength or Fighting Spirit when consuming 3 or more, allowing you to get skill resets more frequently in Martial Artist form and the full bonus skill damage more often in Sweeping Force form. It additionally gives a bonus **5%** final damage, and in Martial Artist form, increases the dodge and normal attack damage by a further **1.5x**. This is multiplicative to the **1.4x** base value, but is additive with what I call the "normal" multiplier, containing sources such as Shiro matrix, Couant, Shield, etc. This is a very important advancement for main DPS Yulan, and slightly less so, for support.

Next is her A3. This only affects damage for Martial Artist form by granting an extra stack of Internal Strength when you don't get any stacks for **5** seconds, allowing you to gain a little extra every rotation where you swap to your supporting weapons. Other than that, this grants **10%** max HP healing when consuming Internal Strength or Fighting spirit, doubled in solo play. It has a cooldown in Sweeping Force form due to how it's much faster to consume resources there.

Her A5 is your typical death-defying advancement, giving you a hidden buff when consuming resource that prevents lethal damage and heals you **20% max hp** (doubled in solo play), once per 60 seconds.

Finally, her A6 adds an additional **70%** multiplier to Martial Artist form as well as adds an extra **10% final damage**, and the Sweeping Form final damage gains **15% final damage**. These effects all stack with the A1 buffs additively, making this advancement very strong.


Next, let's take a look at her matrices!

Matrices
========



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-ouxxjp56kmcb1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbcc4f37332d303e5da430f39babe62f30eafa5d)


Yulan's 2-piece set applies a constant DOT to enemies around you, while also granting a final damage buff after using any frost skill or discharge, working in the offhand.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-32eopfv7kmcb1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db674e279385b7c6d2220df618824b45a2b14b2)


Her 4-piece set increases final damage when consuming Internal Strength or Fighting Spirit, while also increasing all elemental damage after dealing Frost damage, also working in the offhand.

For this matrix comparison, let's first take a look at the values in sweeping mode.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-hlxf3p8bkmcb1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=985ca27ec017eb1c46e532031dbff59870d31471)


Yulan's matrix is extremely strong - the passive damage it gives really adds up, and makes it even stronger than Fiona's matrix in this case. Icarus's matrix at 3* is roughly equal to her 0* matrix with base stats included, but that being said, it's not too far behind Lyra + Samir. Standard matrices aren't too strong here, as the field time is split a good amount. Icarus would be the main DPS in this case.



![r/TowerofFantasy - Note that 2Lyra/2Samir is +40% at 3*, I forgot to include it on this graph. It is the optimal set for maximum investment, with Yulan and Fiona matrices on the side.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-sjgi8pahkmcb1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01103681f7e593b14a7c4160181dc824c0a8e41)


Note that 2Lyra/2Samir is +40% at 3*, I forgot to include it on this graph. It is the optimal set for maximum investment, with Yulan and Fiona matrices on the side.

How about Martial mode? The story with the limited matrices is similar to before, but standard matrices here are much more viable, almost rivaling the strength of Icarus and Alyss's matrices, as a majority of damage is dealt with Yulan on-field. This helps close the gap between Martial and Sweeping mode at lower investments. Wait, what gap? We'll cover that in the comparisons section - for now, let's learn about the rotations and build!

Rotations & Build
=================



![r/TowerofFantasy - Icarus/Alyss matrices both work just fine. If you have Lyra/Samir, slot that on Yulan, and use Yulan on Alyss.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-q7qtqqa0lmcb1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=351398752c998e7c828108ab17079040274df96d)



Icarus/Alyss matrices both work just fine. If you have Lyra/Samir, slot that on Yulan, and use Yulan on Alyss.

We'll start out with main DPS Yulan, using Martial Artist Mode. In this comp, you'll pair with Alyss and Fiona, using Wellspring, Maelstrom, and Yulan's trait. You'll also don their respective matrices, with Alyss and Icarus matrices being interchangeable.

**Titan Stats**

For Titan stats, the priorities, in order, are: skill damage, normal attack damage, generic damage, dodge damage, and finally, discharge damage. Weak point, obviously, is a very powerful pick that is conditional.



![r/TowerofFantasy - The Main DPS Yulan rotation.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-78n52f6qkmcb1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=5294cd413e24813c486ba8209cbcb68af2c52c5a)


The Main DPS Yulan rotation.

Start out by casting Alyss's skill, canceling it into Fiona's discharge and skill. [If you don't have a discharge, that's fine, the rotation plays out the same.] Switch to Yulan and pop Maelstrom and your relics, and start using her dodge to auto combo, canceling before the final auto to repeat the combo. For this first rotation only, use her skill upon reaching 3 stacks for the A1 buff. Continue DPSing, using her skill whenever you get to 5 stacks, until around 5 seconds are left on Maelstrom's cooldown - at which point, you switch to Alyss, instantly cancel her discharge, and then start her skill, quickly canceling it to discharge to Fiona. From here on out, you repeat the same general rotation, but there's plenty of optimizing to do with her stacks.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-48msuyhtkmcb1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=6857ddfac14374441c0a95a0c9bd3be0b19c9041)


First off, because you can store up to 10 stacks, and Maelstrom ramps up over 10 seconds, you want to save the stacks for when Maelstrom is fully ramped up if possible. Secondly, you want to optimize with your relics, and make sure you save as many stacks as possible prior to a rotation that has your relics coming off cooldown.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-ssjqzpz6lmcb1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=917b70cb85f09bcebbb40c2ed9506d7e72a5bb0a)



What about with support Yulan, using Sweeping Focus? Here, you'll use Icarus and Fiona, with Hydro Focus and Torrential Force, as well as their respective matrices.

**Titan Stats**

The best Titan stat here is still skill damage, with discharge and generic damage as the other viable options.



![r/TowerofFantasy - The Sweeping Force rotation. Use a jump attack between Icarus yoyos for optimal damage.](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-jhdyognvkmcb1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=188d321fbab0100e4a99224cdec9e9c06ed12988)



The Sweeping Force rotation. Use a jump attack between Icarus yoyos for optimal damage.

For this comp, precharge is important, as you need to use Yulan's discharge to start building up stacks of Fighting Spirit. If you do not have a discharge built up already, skip Yulan's rotation part at the start, only switching to her as soon as you build up a discharge. Otherwise, start out with Yulan's discharge and skill, followed by that of Fiona. Switch to Icarus and use his discharge and skill, followed by Return to Loneliness charges, before tapping Torrential Force for two more charges. If you did not have a precharge, tap Torrential immediately on swapping instead.


After exhausting all yoyo charges, discharge to Yulan, and the rotation repeats from here. Due to the high charge granted by Icarus and Torrential Force, coupled with Yulan's discharge refund, you'll be using every character's discharge, spamming Icarus's second skill for constant procs of Yulan's passive, which is like essentially a stronger version of Alyss. Here's a real time loop of the rotation.

The remaining comps are either niche or suboptimal, so I will cover them briefly.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-16i2e652mmcb1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d29bf9def867a66ed1f5cf5e4b50e4c41be9bf1)


The Altered team uses support Yulan, focusing on discharging as many times as possible to spam Lin skills, which procs Yulan's passive. As such, Lin A6 is a requirement for this team. You'll use Hydro Focus and Torrential Force here, prioritizing discharges to Yulan every 10 seconds, and then Fiona discharges otherwise.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-wbmc86e3mmcb1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a61302992a3b50edb7952d267d9b15b9f35267)


The Sweeping triple Frost team is a copium copy of the altered version - you'll charge on Alyss to use Icarus's discharge and follow up skills. While you get both Alyss and Yulan proccing their effects on Icarus's skillcasts, you're only getting half as many to begin with due to not being able to double dip with Fiona, which makes this comp relatively weak. **Using Frigg/Alyss with a Martial comp is a viable option, though!**

Comparisons
===========

Before we dive into comparisons, remember to take things with a grain of salt!

Let's compare the various Yulan comps to each other. Here's a chart with 4 different teams - the standard Fiona Martial and Sweeping comps, a double altered Sweeping comp, and finally, a triple Frost Sweeping comp. This chart will show the total power of each comp, with varying advancements of Yulan.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-yelfu0xdmmcb1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9399f6a5d9e870177b6ebff3ec0213ddbd11b0)


The Sweeping and Martial comps come fairly close to each other at max investment, giving us one of the highest A0 to A6 total damage differentials we've seen so far.

The Martial comp starts out very weak, but scales the most with advancements. As we saw from previous tables - if you want to play main DPS Yulan, the A1 is extremely important.

The double altered comp is very lax on advancements, and can function well with even an A0 Yulan. Finally, the triple Frost comp is just a very copium comp. It's unfortunate that Fiona is such a staple in this comp, but it is what it is.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-1gbfeiqfmmcb1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db8a3a87ea80525fbd7e8d29c207c90e9b265f5)


How about Frost verses the other elements? Unsurprisingly, she does raise the bar over flame by a good bit. The Alyss comp is potentially even stronger than the Icarus comp - it's nice to see an older character actually be relevant. The altered comp is also very close even at max investment, and as we saw from the previous graph, it only requires A0 Yulan to obtain most of the power.



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-r9qc0bkhmmcb1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=c908019aea21c75604a9db46797add7ca37ef3a7)


At a dolphin investment level, Yulan's strength is relatively a bit lower, as a lot of her power is loaded into her matrices. The alternate comps fails to powercreep Flame at this level... but is that really a bad thing?

(sorry too late to draw out the other 2 graphs lol)



![r/TowerofFantasy - 【Math】Complete Yulan Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-yulan-analysis-guide-v0-h0iz68wjmmcb1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcd3ea84190029c6b11da75747c9fd4e1361db5c)


At both F2P+ and F2P levels, Yulan just slightly raises the bar over Flame. Overall, the powercreep seems to only be at the maximum investment level, with the rest of the investment levels having a mostly similar ceiling.

Closing Thoughts
================

Yulan is a versatile character who can support a number of different builds, even synergizing with older characters such as Alyss and Lin extremely well, bringing damage that is even competitive to the meta build. She powercreeps the total damage potential only at the whale level, leaving all the lower investment levels' power ceilings fairly close to each other.
