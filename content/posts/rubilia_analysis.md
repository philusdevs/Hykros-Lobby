TLDR
====

Theoretically up to 10% powercreep over Umi GNN comp, though in practice, 12-18% of your damage is from A1 which requires enemies to stand absolutely still, and you'll lose a good amount of that.

Worse than Tian Lang if you don't have A3 Fenrir, and better than Tian at A1, A5, and A6 when you do.

A5 is the most important advancement, A6 and A1 are small bonuses, A3 nigh useless

Kit
===

Rubilia's kit is very straightforward. The core of it revolves around her **Crystamax Thorns**, so we'll start with where they come from - her discharge.

Her discharge generates **3** Crystamax Thorns around the target, while increasing Volt Damage by **7%** for **30**seconds. While these thorns don't inherently do anything by themselves, they are essential to the kit. The discharge also gives you **2** charges of **Feedback**, which enhance her dodge attack with a few bonus effects. It causes each dodge attack to do **72%** additional damage proportional to the amount of thorns, and then also heals the thorns for **25%** of their max health, while resetting their position and duration. So, why does the health of the thorns matter? Let's look at her skill next.

Her skill causes her to draw enemies together, draining up to **100%** health from the Thorns. While the Thorns have health to drain, each hit deals an additional **40%** damage x amount of Thorns. As such, it is important to make sure to use the dodges after her discharge to heal Thorns back up, so you can get as much bonus damage on this skill as possible. Note that generating new Thorns will not replace old Thorns, even when said Thorns are out of health. The health drain effect on the Thorns additionally counts towards any effects that require you to lose a % of your own health, making Rubilia's strength primarily lie with Fenrir's A3, which deals a large amount of passive damage as you lose health.

Her trait grants 8% Volt Damage for each Volt weapon equipped, as a unique multiplier separate from matrices. This trait gives an edge to triple Volt teams, which we'll touch on later.

The rest of her kit isn't too much to write home about - her basic attack damage can't compare to that of Fenrir, so all her value is essentially in her skill and discharge.

|  | MV/s | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rubilia Auto | 248%/s | Good at charging |
| Rubilia Aerial | 317%/s | Good at charging |
| Rubilia Auto Hold | 266%/s | This makes you dash way past the target but can be useful as a gap closer |
| Rubilia Plunge | 281%/s |  |
| Fenrir Auto | 481%/s | Includes note detonations |
| Fenrir Aerial | 387%/s | Includes note detonations |
| Fenrir Plunge Roar | 520%/s | Includes note detonations |

She has a funny passive where she can turn a non-boss Grayspace entity into a temporary ally, though the value of this is questionable, as the damage potential of mobs to other mobs is irrelevant, and you essentially make a mob invulnerable from yourself. Aside from combat, though, she offers some neat utility with an unlimited jetpack and super fast gliding!


Let's now look into her advancements and their values!

Advancements
============

We'll examine the power of each of Rubilia's advancements in two teams - one team with Fenrir and Fiona, and then a triple volt with Fenrir and Tian Lang.

Rubilia's A1 adds a DOT effect around each of her thorns after triggering Feedback, dealing **66.7%** damage every **2**seconds for **30** seconds total. This adds a good amount of damage in both comps, though note that a lot of the potential of this advancement may not be realized in content where enemies move constantly.

Next is her A3, which generates a Thorn when using any weapon skill or discharge. This helps the initial ramp-up, but does absolutely nothing after, as newly generated thorns will not replace old thorns. As such, this only improves damage by a minor amount, and is more useful in shorter fights than longer ones.

Her A5 causes Feedback to restore the HP of Crystamax thorns by **50%**. This is a very significant advancement, this allows you to fully restore the HP of thorns after each discharge, allowing you to benefit from the full bonus damage on the subsequent skill.

Finally, her A6 causes her discharge to grant an extra **12%** Volt damage buff when casting. This adds a good amount of bonus value to both comps.




| Rubilia Advancement | Gain from A0 in Fiona Volt | Gain from A0 in Triple Volt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0 | 100% | 100% |
| A1 | 118% | 113% |
| A3 | 121% | 116% |
| A5 | 143% | 132% |
| A6 | 159% | 147% |

Overall, her advancements are relatively more important in the Fiona comp than the triple Volt comp, and this makes sense since Fiona is a buffer, the raw damage on Rubilia's advancements are worth relatively more. Note that, again, this is not a comparison between comps - we'll cover that later!

Next, let's go over matrices.

Matrices
========

Rubilia's 2-piece increases Volt ATK unconditionally, working in the offhand. This boosts damage by a decent amount, though this effect is mostly inferior to the Fiona matrix, which might as well be up all the time. The 4-piece effect increases all elemental damage when dealing damage with a Volt weapon. This elemental damage stacks additively with Scylla and Tian's matrices, so note that using multiple of these options together would be inefficient. In addition, this increases the Crystamax Thorn limit from 5 to 6, which contributes quite a significant amount of damage. How much, exactly, let's take a look...

Rubilia's matrix blows the rest out of the water, even Fiona's matrix. However, do note that this is with all A6 units - if you do not have Fenrir A3, then the value will be relatively smaller. Without the +1 thorn effect, the Rubilia 3* matrix is worth around **+46%** damage instead of **+61%**. Due to how damage is distributed fairly evenly between Fenrir and Rubilia's on-field time, matrices such as Samir/Shiro are relatively weaker now because of it.

Team Comps
=========

Let's start taking a look at different teamcomps and their rotations, starting with the Volt + Altered team.



![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-iz5wkjhoem3b1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce63a0742998ed75a1a724840bdbb4dd736d9c1f)


The ideal team here consists of Fiona, Fenrir, and Rubilia. There really aren't any suitable replacement options, as a lot of Rubilia's synergy falls with Fenrir A3, and without that, the damage falls flat. Lin can work as a replacement for Fiona, but note that these raw comparisons do not include matrices, which would push Fiona even higher. We use Hydro Focus and Wellspring as skills here, for the generic buffs. Torrential Force can be a viable option if you want to do the double discharge rotation, which involves discharging to both Fiona and Rubilia every rotation, as opposed to only Rubilia. We use Fenrir, Fiona, and Rubilia matrices here. Tian's matrix is phased out in a meta comp due to stacking additively with Rubilia.

"Why is Lin so close to Fiona here?"

Fiona discharge is skipped in a Rubilia rotation, and this table also does not include matrices, and Fiona's matrices are quite a good amount more powerful than Lin's. Also, execute damage is not included.

For demonstration purposes, an optimal parse with starting charge will be used. You can perform the same rotation minus the discharges, but the ramp up will be slower.


![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-f9p1qe5xem3b1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=1708f8fe6208653483fd7d93b566ef2572b41b83)



Start out with Fiona's skill, and then switch into Fenrir. Use her skill, followed by A1 to dodge to A1, cancelling the end of the second A1 to discharge to Rubilia. Use her skill, followed by two dodges, to heal the Thorns back up. Autoattack for a couple seconds to wait for Fiona's skill to come back up. Switch to Fiona to use her skill, then back into Fenrir, where you use her plunge to roar combo until her A1 comes back up, and then do A1 to dodge to A1 again, cancelling early to go into Rubilia again, where you do the same as before: skill, and two dodges. Use Fiona's skill again, and then go to Fenrir and start a new Songworld. The rotation for the second Songworld is NOT the same due to Rubilia's uneven skill cooldown. As such, you'll DPS on Fenrir as normal, doing your A1/dodge combo twice, and then a couple plunge roar combos, before going out to Rubilia for her usual skills, then going into Fiona for her skill, and then doing another Fenrir A1 combo. From here on out, the rotation repeats.


![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-7yc7pp9zem3b1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff8e0610e13e23550348aeea97e221add7c5d50)



A triple Volt team consists of Tian Lang, Fenrir, and Rubilia. Replacing Tian Lang with Nemesis is a viable option if you don't have Tian Lang invested in, but other replacement options are pretty copium, especially if you replace Fenrir. Here, the ideal matrices to use are Rubilia, Fenrir, and Tian Lang.

The Tian rotation plays pretty much the same the Fiona rotation, except you swap into Tian less frequently due to his skill having a longer cooldown. Here, I'll copy pasta that rotation over here for reference.

Comparisons
===========

Let's dive into comparisons! But not before going over our DISCLAIMER, to note that you should take numbers with a grain of salt, as this is theorycrafting, and the numbers shown will be the theoretical maximum, which may not reflect actual combat!

The first important question I want to answer is, "how is Rubilia without A3 Fenrir"? Simply put, not good at all. Fenrir's A3 has so much synergy with Rubilia, that without Fenrir A3, you're probably better off running something else, like Tian Lang, speaking of which, here's a comparison graph of varying advancements of Rubilia and Tian, with Fenrir A1. As you can see, Rubilia is... quite weak here, overshadowed by Tian Lang completely. Next, we'll look at one with Fenrir A6 (the real breaking point is at A3, I'm just using A6 as an example). Here, Tian A3 can perform better than Rubilia A3, especially considering that Rubilia's A1 can miss a lot of damage against moving targets. However, using Tian does mean you'll be hurting yourself a lot, so that's the tradeoff. Rubilia becomes stronger at A5 and above, and recall that Rubilia's matrix buffs her up a ton, so she takes quite an investment to raise the bar. I can't believe they made another Cobalt-B.

![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-47kqb2w4fm3b1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=466c09567e4fd8ec6447a71af83889140aa0e752)


Now, how does Volt compare to the rest of the meta? At the maximum investment, Rubilia can theoretically top the DPS charts, though I need to emphasize again that usability is a concern. Her A1 accounts for roughly 12% of the total damage, and a lot of this damage is lost when fighting any mobile targets, so this cuts her value substantially. The triple Volt team lags behind the Rubilia comp a bit, but this comp has more raw damage and is relatively less reliant on Rubilia's A1 damage.


![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-7jnyvxe7fm3b1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea452f5f003d6635df197a004cb1724051e20bf)


In a dolphin investment comp, Rubilia only raises the bar by a small amount over Tian Lang. The triple Volt comp also does better than the Fiona Volt comp here, as at this investment level, since limited matrices aren't considered, Fiona's powerful matrices don't give her that extra boost.

![r/TowerofFantasy - [Math] Complete Rubilia Analysis/Guide](https://preview.redd.it/math-complete-rubilia-analysis-guide-v0-az6qrth8fm3b1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d49c5e5262c52709b5c08938c5e2998a07b1e0d)



At an F2P investment, Rubilia is a downgrade from Tian, especially seeing that this is chart is comparing A1, and A1 Tian is useless so you only really need A0 to reach the previous Volt level of damage. That being said, that doesn't mean Volt is in the bad place, as it's still doing better than F2P Physical and Altered, and roughly the same as Frost.

TLDR: Rubilia is not F2P friendly, unless you appreciate her model or exploration features.

Summary
=======

Rubilia can be a powerful addition to Volt teams, but needs a high investment level, in both her own advancements, matrices, and even requires Fenrir A3, to function properly. Her kit design is questionable, as you can grief yourself with her grayspace mind-control skill, and her value is literally defined by one specific advancement on another character. But hey, at least she has a nice model!
