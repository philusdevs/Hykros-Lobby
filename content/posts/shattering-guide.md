  job is to shatter, including the best weapon lineup, matrices, and relics.

If you are a tank in some content, and your only priority is to shatter a shield, here's a how-to guide to set yourself up for success. Note: This is mainly meant as comps for the raids such as the 3.1 and 3.2 limited-time raids, but the advice in this guide is generic, and can be used in other content.

## Main things to take in:

The main shatterer is Shiro. Her skill has the highest shatter within all of the game. Although she is a DPS, she out-shatters everyone else. This means to have the highest shatter, you must trigger Fortitude resonance (i.e. equip 2 tank weapons and have Shiro as the third), and focus on using her on-field when shield is up.

### Recommended Weapon Lineups:

#### Lineup 1:

### Lineup 2:

![Lineup 2: Shiro, Ene, Huma](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1143886813593882664/1143888404069757038/image.png)

Both of these lineups are possible to obtain within the current Standard weapons pool, as Saki Fuwa was just recently added in 3.1. 

The reason for using Saki Fuwa is for her 1\* skill resets, which will be explained shortly. The use of Ene is to trigger both Frost and Fortitude resonance. Use Huma instead of Saki Fuwa if you do not possess her 1\*.

### Recommended Matrices Lineup:

Matrices are also something to consider, and the reason for this is that there exists a few sets which can increase shatter. Those include:

#### Lineup 1:

![Lineup 1: 2pc Shiro and 2pc Scylla](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1143886813593882664/1143889333665931284/image.png)

Lineup 2:

![Lineup 2: 3pc Wind Blade (with 4th slot filled by high star SSR matrice)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1143886813593882664/1143888911295336478/image.png)

Lineup 1 is achievable using the Mirroria Gachapon machines, Adventurer's Log, Suppressor upgrades, Joint Operation rewards, and world boss chests. If you have not grabbed these, however, using Wind Blade 3pc will do just fine, which you can get as a random weekly Dream Machine rewards. Read up on the matrices here:

### Relics:

The main focus is using Hologram Projector, so that you can majorly increase your shatter by having a clone also use Shiro's skill. However, unless you use Zero's trait and use skills in between shields to lower the cooldown of the relic, you will most likely only have it be usable every second shield (assuming ~2 minutes between shield, like Zhuyan's in the limited raid). That can also vary even more if you don't have the 2* advancement of the relic, so that the cooldown is lowered to 120s.



### Saki Resets:

The way to effectively make use of Saki's resets is to set it up so that you have 4 stacks on the buff bar of her reset counter, and then after using Hologram projector you use Saki's skill twice in a row. 



That's all I have to say for this. Happy shattering!
